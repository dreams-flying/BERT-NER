two cdna clones were sequenced and provided 2,250 nucleotides ( nt ) of dna sequence information .
1,3 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA

there is a single methionine codon-initiated open reading frame of 1,458 nt in frame with a homeobox and a cax repeat , and the open reading frame is predicted to encode a protein of 51,659 daltons .
4,9 G#DNA|16,17 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA|24,27 G#DNA

when the homeodomain from hb24 was compared to known mammalian and drosophila homeodomains it was found to be only moderately conserved , but when it was compared to a highly diverged drosophila homeodomain , h2.0 , it was found to be 80 % identical .
2,3 G#DNA|4,5 G#DNA|9,13 G#DNA|32,33 G#DNA|31,33 G#DNA

the hb24 mrna was absent or present at low levels in normal b and t lymphocytes ; however , with the appropriate activation signal hb24 mrna was induced within several hours even in the presence of cycloheximide .
1,3 G#RNA|14,16 G#cell_type|24,26 G#RNA

characterization of hb24 expression in lymphoid and select developing tissues was performed by in situ hybridization .
2,3 G#DNA

positive hybridization was found in thymus , tonsil , bone marrow , developing vessels , and in fetal brain .


hb24 is likely to have an important role in lymphocytes as well as in certain developing tissues .

platelet-activating factor induces phospholipid turnover , calcium flux , arachidonic acid liberation , eicosanoid generation , and oncogene expression in a human b cell line .
0,2 G#protein|17,18 G#DNA|21,25 G#cell_line

platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response .
0,2 G#protein

studies of the actions of platelet-activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets .
5,7 G#protein|11,12 G#cell_type|13,14 G#cell_type|16,17 G#cell_type

in this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet-activating factor on b lymphocytes .
10,12 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_type

employing the ebv-transformed human b cell line skw6.4 , we demonstrate that platelet-activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32p into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanolamine at concentrations ranging from 10 ( -9 ) to 10 ( -6 ) m .
3,7 G#cell_line|2,7 G#cell_line|7,8 G#cell_line|12,14 G#protein

the inactive precursor , lyso-platelet-activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10 ( -7 ) m had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids .
4,6 G#protein

we also show that platelet-activating factor from 10 ( -12 ) to 10 ( -6 ) m induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso- platelet-activating factor was again ineffective .
4,6 G#protein|29,31 G#protein

we further demonstrate the impact of platelet-activating factor binding to b cells by measuring platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production .
6,8 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|14,16 G#protein

moreover , platelet-activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun .
2,4 G#protein|11,13 G#DNA|13,14 G#DNA|15,16 G#DNA

finally we explored the possible role of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5-lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet-activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase a2 .
19,20 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|34,36 G#protein

in summary , platelet-activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure b cell line .

positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression by a novel b-cell-specific enhancer element .
5,7 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA

a new b-cell-specific enhancer element has been identified 3' of e4 and the octamerlike motifs in the human immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene enhancer .
2,5 G#DNA|10,15 G#DNA|17,20 G#protein|17,22 G#DNA

tandem copies of this 67-bp mnli-alui fragment , when fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the conalbumin promoter , stimulated transcription in b cells but not in jurkat t cells or hela cells .
4,7 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA|24,26 G#cell_type|29,32 G#cell_line|33,35 G#cell_line

footprinting analysis revealed that the identical sequence ccgaaactgaaaagg , designated e6 , was protected by nuclear extracts from b cells , t cells , or hela cells .
10,11 G#DNA|18,20 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_type

gel mobility shift assays using a synthetic e6 motif detected a b-cell-specific complex in addition to a ubiquitous band found also in t cells and hela cells .
6,9 G#DNA|11,13 G#protein|22,24 G#cell_type|25,27 G#cell_line

in agreement with the results of gel retardation assays , tandem copies of the e6 motif stimulated transcription in arh77 and raji cells but not in jurkat or hela cells .
14,16 G#DNA|19,20 G#cell_line|21,23 G#cell_line|26,27 G#cell_line|28,30 G#cell_line

furthermore , a mutant e6 motif lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity .
3,6 G#DNA

in striking contrast to the mouse ig heavy-chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a b-cell-specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .
5,9 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA|18,21 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA|27,29 G#DNA|35,37 G#protein

interestingly , the mnli-alui fragment could suppress the basal-level activity of the conalbumin promoter in both jurkat and hela cells .
3,5 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|16,17 G#cell_line|18,20 G#cell_line

moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the mnli-alui fragment in hela cells but not in b cells .
11,13 G#DNA|14,16 G#cell_line|19,21 G#cell_type

thus , the novel enhancer element identified in this study is probably a target site for both positive and negative factors .

charybdotoxin-sensitive , ca(2+) -dependent membrane potential changes are not involved in human t or b cell activation and proliferation .
12,16 G#cell_type

the involvement of ion channels in b and t lymphocyte activation is supported by many reports of changes in ion fluxes and membrane potential after mitogen binding .
3,5 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

human t and b lymphocytes demonstrate an early and transient hyperpolarization after ligand binding .
0,5 G#cell_type

inasmuch as the change in membrane potential is dependent on elevation of free cytosolic calcium , the hyperpolarization is presumably through opening of ca(2+)-stimulated k+ channels .


we have used charybdotoxin , a known inhibitor of ca(2+)-dependent k+ channels , to study the role of these channels in lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .
9,12 G#protein

we demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand-induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in b and t cells in a dose-dependent fashion , without affecting changes in cytosolic ca2+ .
11,15 G#cell_type

however , blockade of the ca(2+)-activated k+ channel is not associated with changes in cell-cycle gene activation , il-2 production , il-2r expression or b and t cell mitogenesis .
5,8 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

these results imply that membrane potential changes secondary to the ligand-dependent opening of ca(2+)-activated k+ channels are not involved in b and t lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .

activity of the kappa b enhancer of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain in somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by the nuclear localization of nf-kappa b .
3,6 G#DNA|8,12 G#protein|13,16 G#cell_line|23,25 G#protein

the two nuclear proteins nf-kappa b ( consisting of subunits p50 an dp65 ) and the dna-binding subunit of nf-kappa b ( p50 ) by itself , also called kbf1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human t-cell line iarc 301.5 .
1,4 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|41,44 G#cell_line|44,46 G#cell_line

in order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa b enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between iarc 301.5 and a murine myeloma .
9,10 G#protein|16,19 G#DNA|30,32 G#cell_line|34,36 G#cell_line

most hybrids express both kbf1 and nf-kappa b in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only kbf1 .
4,5 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

the kappa b enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) receptor alpha chain ( il-2r alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear nf-kappa b .
1,4 G#DNA|9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|9,16 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|25,26 G#cell_line|28,30 G#protein|27,30 G#protein

these findings show that nuclear nf-kappa b is necessary to activate the kappa b enhancer , while kbf1 by itself is not sufficient .
5,7 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|12,15 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein

we propose that kbf1 is a competitive inhibitor of nf-kappa b and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of il-2 and il-2 alpha genes during the immune response .

t-helper-cell determinants in protein antigens are preferentially located in cysteine-rich antigen segments resistant to proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin b , l , and d .
0,2 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|17,24 G#protein

we report on a computer algorithm capable of predicting the location of t-helper-cell epitopes in protein antigen ( ag ) by analysing the ag amino acid sequence .
12,14 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|24,27 G#protein

the algorithm was constructed with the aim of identifying segments in ag which are resistant to proteolytic degradation by the enzymes cathepsin b , l , and d .
11,12 G#protein|21,28 G#protein

these are prominent enzymes in the endocytic pathway through which soluble protein ag enter apc , and resistant segments in ag may , therefore , be expected to contain more t-cell determinants than susceptible segments .
3,4 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|10,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|30,32 G#protein|33,35 G#protein

from information available in the literature on the substrate specificity of the three enzymes , it is clear that a cysteine is not accepted in any of the s2 , s1 , s1' , and s2' subsites of cathepsin b and l , and not in the s1 and s1' subsites of cathepsin d .
13,14 G#protein|28,37 G#protein|38,42 G#protein|47,48 G#protein|49,50 G#protein|52,54 G#protein

moreover , we have noticed that cysteine -containing t-cell determinants in a number of protein ag are particularly rich in the amino acids alanine , glycine , lysine , leucine , serine , threonine , and valine .
6,10 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|14,16 G#protein

by searching protein ag for clusters of amino acids containing cysteine and two of the other amino acids we were able to predict 17 out of 23 empirically known t-cell determinants in the ag with a relatively low number of false ( positive ) predictions .
3,4 G#protein|29,31 G#protein|33,34 G#protein

furthermore , we present a new principle for searching ag for potential amphipatic alpha-helical protein segments .
9,10 G#protein|12,16 G#protein

such segments accord well with empirically known t-cell determinants and our algorithm produces a lower number of false positive predictions than the principle based on discrete fourier transformations previously described .

contribution of nf-kappa b and sp1 binding motifs to the replicative capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 : distinct patterns of viral growth are determined by t-cell types .
2,4 G#protein|5,8 G#DNA|27,29 G#cell_type

starting with a replication-incompetent molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 , lacking all the nf-kappa b and sp1 binding sites present in the native long terminal repeat ( ltr ) , proviruses containing reconstructed ltrs with individual or combinations of nf-kappa b and sp1 elements were generated and evaluated for their capacity to produce virus progeny following transfection-cocultivation .
16,22 G#DNA|25,29 G#DNA|30,31 G#DNA|35,37 G#DNA|42,47 G#DNA

virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different human t-cell types depending on which element ( s ) was present in the ltr .
15,17 G#cell_type|14,17 G#cell_type|20,21 G#DNA|28,29 G#DNA

for example , in experiments involving proviral clones with ltrs containing one or two nf-kappa b elements ( and no sp1 binding sites ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( peripheral blood lymphocytes = mt4 greater than h9 greater than cem greater than jurkat ) was observed .
9,10 G#DNA|14,16 G#protein|14,17 G#DNA|20,23 G#DNA|36,37 G#cell_type|34,37 G#cell_type|38,39 G#cell_line|41,42 G#cell_line|44,45 G#cell_line|47,48 G#cell_line

of note was the associated emergence of second-site ltr revertants which involved an alteration of the tata box .
7,9 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA

these results suggest that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ltr possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different t-cell types and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of transcriptional factors present .

stimulation of interferon beta gene transcription in vitro by purified nf-kappa b and a novel th protein .
2,5 G#DNA|10,12 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

the human interferon beta ( ifn-beta ) regulatory element consists of multiple enhanson domains which are targets for transcription factors involved in inducible expression of the promoter .
1,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|1,9 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|18,20 G#protein|26,27 G#DNA

to further characterize the protein-dna interactions mediating ifn-beta induction , positive regulatory domain ( prd ) ii binding proteins were purified from phorbol ester induced jurkat t-cells and from ifn primed , cycloheximide/polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treated hela s3 cells .
7,8 G#protein|10,17 G#DNA|10,19 G#protein|25,27 G#cell_line|29,30 G#protein|29,38 G#cell_line

from hela cells , two major proteins of 52 and 45 kilodaltons ( kd ) copurified with dna binding activity , whereas from t-cells , four proteins -- a major protein of 52 kd and three minor proteins of 82 , 67 , and 43-47 kd -- were purified .
1,3 G#cell_line|8,15 G#protein|23,24 G#cell_type|29,31 G#protein|32,34 G#protein|36,38 G#protein|39,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein|44,46 G#protein

also , an induction specific dna binding protein was purified from hela cells that interacted with the ( aagtga ) 4 tetrahexamer sequence and the prdi domain .
4,8 G#protein|11,13 G#cell_line|21,23 G#DNA|25,27 G#DNA

this protein is immunologically distinct from irf-1/isgf2 .
6,7 G#protein

uninduced or sendai virus induced hela extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of ifn beta promoter deletions .
18,22 G#DNA

deletions upstream of the prdii element increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter .
4,6 G#DNA|19,20 G#DNA

a 2-4-fold increase in ifn-beta promoter transcription was observed in sendai virus induced extracts , and deletion of prdi and prdii elements decreased this induced level of transcription .
4,6 G#DNA|18,19 G#DNA|20,21 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA

when purified prdii and tetrahexamer binding proteins were added to the induced extract , a 4-fold increase in transcription was observed .
2,7 G#protein

these experiments demonstrate that it is possible to modulate ifn-beta transcription in vitro but indicate that additional proteins may be required to fully activate ifn-beta transcription .

the rhombotin family of cysteine -rich lim-domain oncogenes : distinct members are involved in t-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13 .
1,3 G#DNA|4,8 G#DNA|14,16 G#DNA|17,22 G#DNA

a chromosomal translocation in a t-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene .
9,11 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA

this gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine -rich regions called lim domains , which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins .
7,10 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated .
4,6 G#DNA

one of these , designated rhom-2 , is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13 , where a cluster of t-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur ; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the rhom-2 gene .
5,6 G#DNA|10,13 G#DNA|14,16 G#DNA|21,24 G#DNA|30,31 G#DNA|35,36 G#DNA|35,37 G#DNA

human and mouse rhom-2 are highly conserved and , like rhombotin , encode two tandem cysteine -rich lim domains .
0,4 G#DNA|10,11 G#DNA|17,19 G#protein|14,19 G#DNA

rhom-2 mrna is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system , lung , kidney , liver , and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus .
0,1 G#DNA|0,2 G#RNA

the other gene , designated rhom-3 , is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the lim domain of rhombotin .
5,6 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA|21,22 G#DNA

since the rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in t-cell tumors , the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined .
2,3 G#DNA|2,4 G#DNA|13,15 G#cell_type|22,23 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA

a second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example .
5,6 G#DNA

therefore , chromosome bands 11p15 ( rhombotin ) and 11p13 ( rhom-2 ) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in t-cell leukemia , with the 11p15 target more rarely involved .
2,5 G#DNA|6,7 G#DNA|9,10 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|25,27 G#DNA

the results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of t-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine -rich lim domains .

nf-kappa b activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha in the jurkat t cell line is independent of protein kinase a , protein kinase c , and ca(2+) -regulated kinases .
0,2 G#protein|4,8 G#protein|10,14 G#cell_line|17,20 G#protein|21,24 G#protein|26,29 G#protein

nf-kappa b is a dna-binding regulatory factor able to control transcription of a number of genes , including human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) genes .
0,2 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|18,25 G#DNA

in t cells , nf-kappa b is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf alpha ) .
1,3 G#cell_type|4,6 G#protein|17,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein

in the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to nf-kappa b activation by tnf alpha in a human t cell line ( jurkat ) and its subclone jct6 , which presents a deficiency in the pka transduction pathway .
12,14 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|20,24 G#cell_line|25,26 G#cell_line|30,31 G#cell_line|38,39 G#protein

we found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and tnf alpha were able to activate nf-kappa b .
12,14 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

phorbol activation was positively modulated by ca2+ influx while tnf alpha activation was not .
9,11 G#protein

furthermore , while pma activation was inhibited by the pkc inhibitor staurosporin , the tnf alpha effect was unchanged .
9,10 G#protein|14,16 G#protein

tnf alpha did not activate camp production and its signal was not modulated by camp activators .
0,2 G#protein

moreover , camp activators did not activate nf-kappa b in jurkat cells .
7,9 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_line

thus , tnf alpha -induced nf-kappa b activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal-mediating kinases such as protein kinase c ( pkc ) , protein kinase a , or ca(2+)-regulated kinases .
2,4 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|22,25 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|29,32 G#protein|34,36 G#protein

furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated nf-kappa b activation by both tnf alpha and pkc , by a mechanism that increases nf-kappa b /i kappa b dissociation without affecting the nf-kappa b translocation step .

the functional domains of the murine thy-1 gene promoter .
5,9 G#DNA

the thy-1 gene promoter resembles a " housekeeping " promoter in that it is located within a methylation-free island , lacks a canonical tata box , and displays heterogeneity in the 5'-end termini of the mrna .
1,4 G#DNA|6,10 G#DNA|17,19 G#DNA|22,25 G#DNA|31,33 G#RNA|35,36 G#RNA

using transgenic mice , we show that this promoter does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position-dependent manner .
8,9 G#DNA

it can only be activated in a tissue-specific manner by elements that lie downstream of the initiation site .
16,18 G#DNA

we have analyzed the functional domains of the minimal thy-1 promoter and show that the dominant promoter elements consist of multiple binding sites for the transcription factor sp1 , an inverted ccaat box , and sequences proximal to the transcription start site .
8,11 G#DNA|15,18 G#DNA|20,23 G#DNA|25,27 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|31,33 G#DNA|39,42 G#DNA

dnase i and gel mobility shift assays show the binding of a number of nuclear factors to these elements , including sp1 and cp1 .
14,16 G#protein|18,19 G#DNA|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

our results show that the structure of this promoter only permits productive interactions of the two transcription factors sp1 and cp1 with the basal transcription machinery in the presence of enhancer sequences .
8,9 G#DNA|16,18 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|30,32 G#DNA

nuclear factor kappa b activates proenkephalin transcription in t lymphocytes .
0,4 G#protein|8,10 G#cell_type

upon activation , t lymphocytes accumulate high levels of the neuropeptide enkephalin which correlate with high levels of proenkephalin mrna in the cells .
3,5 G#cell_type|18,20 G#RNA

here we investigated the transcriptional basis for these changes .


the proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence ggggacgtcccc , named b2 , which is similar to the kappa b sequence ggggactttcc , the binding site of the transcription factor nuclear factor ( nf ) -kappa b .
9,10 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|26,28 G#protein|28,35 G#protein

activation of t lymphocytes induces an nf-kappa b -like binding activity to the b2 site , concomitant with activation of the proenkephalin promoter .
2,4 G#cell_type|6,8 G#protein|13,14 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA

mutations at the b2 site abolish this transcriptional activation .
3,4 G#DNA

the purified homodimer ( two p50s ) of the dna-binding subunit of nf-kappa b binds the b2 site of proenkephalin relatively better than does the heterotetramer ( two p65s plus two p50s ) form of the factor .
2,3 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|16,17 G#DNA|25,26 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|31,32 G#protein

thus , it appears that the t-cell-specific activation of the proenkephalin promoter is mediated by nf-kappa b .
10,12 G#DNA|15,17 G#protein

however , as nf-kappa b is ubiquitous and the transcriptional activation through the b2 site is t cell specific , yet another t-cell-specific factor which synergizes with nf-kappa b should be considered .

induction of nf-kb during monocyte differentiation by hiv type 1 infection .
2,3 G#protein|4,5 G#cell_type

the production of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) progeny was followed in the u937 promonocytic cell line after stimulation either with retinoic acid or pma , and in purified human monocytes and macrophages .
16,20 G#cell_line|31,36 G#cell_type

electrophoretic mobility shift assays and southwestern blotting experiments were used to detect the binding of cellular transactivation factor nf-kb to the double repeat-kb enhancer sequence located in the long terminal repeat .
15,18 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|21,25 G#DNA|28,31 G#DNA

pma treatment , and not retinoic acid treatment of the u937 cells acts in inducing nf-kb expression in the nuclei .
10,12 G#cell_line|15,16 G#protein

in nuclear extracts from monocytes or macrophages , induction of nf-kb occurred only if the cells were previously infected with hiv-1 .
4,5 G#cell_type|6,7 G#cell_type|10,11 G#protein

when u937 cells were infected with hiv-1 , no induction of nf-kb factor was detected , whereas high level of progeny virions was produced , suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication .
1,3 G#cell_line|11,12 G#protein|11,13 G#protein

these results indicate that in monocytic cell lineage , hiv-1 could mimic some differentiation/activation stimuli allowing nuclear nf-kb expression .

similar to 1 ; 14 translocations , this deletion disrupts the scl 5' regulatory region .
11,12 G#protein|11,15 G#DNA

this event is probably mediated by v-(d)-j recombinase activity , although neither locus is an immunoglobulin or a t cell receptor .
15,16 G#protein|18,21 G#protein

two other t cell lines , cem and rpmi 8402 , have essentially identical deletions .
2,5 G#cell_line|6,7 G#cell_line|8,10 G#cell_line

thus , in lymphocytes , growth-affecting genes other than immune receptors risk rearrangements .

thyroid hormone receptors form distinct nuclear protein- dependent and independent complexes with a thyroid hormone response element .
0,3 G#protein|5,11 G#protein|13,17 G#DNA

we have examined the binding of nuclear proteins and recombinant thyroid hormone receptors ( trs ) to the palindromic thyroid hormone responsive element aggtcatgacct ( trep ) using a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
6,8 G#protein|9,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|18,23 G#DNA|25,26 G#DNA

four specific protein-dna complexes were detected after incubation of nuclear extracts ( ne ) from t3-responsive pituitary ( gh3 ) cells with a trep -containing dna fragment .
2,4 G#protein|15,21 G#cell_line|23,24 G#DNA|23,27 G#DNA

this was compared with the trep binding of reticulocyte lysate-synthesized trs .
5,6 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|8,11 G#protein

tr alpha 1 and tr beta 2 each formed a single major tr : trep complex which comigrated with the least retarded complex formed by gh3 ne , while tr beta 1 formed multiple complexes suggesting that it can bind to trep as an oligomer .
0,3 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|14,15 G#DNA|12,16 G#protein|29,32 G#protein|41,42 G#DNA|44,45 G#protein

interestingly , coincubation of 35s- tr alpha 1 , gh3 ne , and unlabeled trep resulted in not only the 35s-tr : trep complex , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing 35s- tr alpha 1 and comigrating with those formed by gh3 extract alone .
5,8 G#protein|4,8 G#protein|14,15 G#DNA|22,23 G#DNA|20,24 G#protein|35,38 G#protein|34,38 G#protein

incubation of each of the trs with ne from cos-7 cells , which do not possess sufficient endogenous trs to mediate t3-responses , resulted in formation of a new , more greatly shifted complex .
5,6 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|31,34 G#protein

a similar , heat labile activity which altered mobility of the tr : tre complex was also present in ne from t3-unresponsive jeg-3 cells .
11,15 G#protein|21,24 G#cell_line

at high concentration of ne , all of the tr bound to trep was more greatly retarded than in the absence of ne .
9,10 G#protein|12,13 G#DNA

truncation of tr alpha 1 at amino acid 210 prevented additional complex formation in the presence of ne without affecting dna binding , suggesting that the carboxyl-terminus of the trs is essential for interaction with nuclear proteins .

cell-specific differences in activation of nf-kappa b regulatory elements of human immunodeficiency virus and beta interferon promoters by tumor necrosis factor .
5,7 G#protein|5,9 G#DNA|10,17 G#DNA|18,21 G#protein

three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) pathogenesis were examined .
6,9 G#protein

tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf-alpha ) mrna production was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification in monocytic u937 cells and in a chronically hiv infected u937 cell line ( u9-iiib ) .
0,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|0,8 G#RNA|17,20 G#cell_line|23,29 G#cell_line|30,31 G#cell_line

tnf-alpha rna was undetectable in u937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in u9-iiib cells .
0,1 G#protein|0,2 G#RNA|5,7 G#cell_line|16,18 G#cell_line

paramyxovirus infection induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the steady-state level of tnf-alpha rna in u9-iiib cells compared with u937 cells , suggesting that hiv-infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of tnf-alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .
13,14 G#protein|13,15 G#RNA|16,18 G#cell_line|20,22 G#cell_line|25,28 G#cell_line|32,33 G#protein

the effects of tnf-alpha on gene expression were examined by transient expression assays using reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids linked to regulatory elements from the hiv long terminal repeat ( ltr ) and the beta interferon promoter .
3,4 G#protein|14,18 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA|29,30 G#DNA|33,36 G#DNA

in u937 and jurkat t lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by tnf-alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type- and promoter context-specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of nf-kappa b -containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of nf-kappa b dna-binding activity .
1,7 G#cell_line|13,15 G#DNA|16,17 G#protein|36,38 G#protein|36,40 G#DNA|45,47 G#protein

although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or tnf-alpha , multimers of the prdii nf-kappa b -binding domain were inducible by both agents .
3,6 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|19,24 G#DNA

tnf-alpha was able to increase expression of the hiv ltr in t cells , but in monocytic cells , tnf-alpha did not induce the hiv ltr above a constitutive level of activity .
0,1 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA|11,13 G#cell_type|16,18 G#cell_type|19,20 G#protein|24,26 G#DNA

this level of nf-kappa b -independent activity appears to be sufficient for virus multiplication , since tnf-alpha treatment had no effect on the kinetics of de novo hiv type 1 ( hiv-1 ) infection and viral rna production in u937 cells .
3,5 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|35,37 G#RNA|39,41 G#cell_line

however , in jurkat cells , tnf-alpha dramatically enhanced the spread of hiv-1 through the cell population and increased viral rna synthesis , indicating that in t cells hiv-1 multiplication was stimulated by tnf-alpha treatment .

functional analysis of cis-linked regulatory sequences in the hla dra promoter by transcription in vitro .
3,6 G#DNA|8,11 G#DNA

two consensus sequences , called x and y boxes , capable of binding nuclear proteins and regulating expression in b cells have been defined within the immediate upstream region of major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii promoters .
5,9 G#DNA|13,15 G#protein|19,21 G#cell_type|30,39 G#DNA

unlike other class ii promoters , the hla-dr alpha ( dra ) promoter also contains one element identical to the " octamer " motif of immunoglobulin variable region promoters that is responsible for b cell-specific transcription .
2,5 G#DNA|7,13 G#DNA|20,24 G#DNA|25,29 G#DNA

this " octamer " in the context of dra appears capable of binding both the ubiquitous ( otf-1 ) and lymphoid-specific ( otf-2 ) " octamer " binding proteins , but at least one other distinct " octamer " complex was found .
2,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|20,29 G#protein|36,40 G#protein

in order to characterize the function of cis-acting elements , we have developed an in vitro system in which a dra promoter construct is transcribed more efficiently in extracts from b cells than in extracts from class ii-negative hela cells .
7,9 G#DNA|20,23 G#DNA|30,32 G#cell_type|36,40 G#cell_line

5' deletion constructs which lacked the y box , but retained the " octamer " motif and tata box were completely inactive , and internal deletion of the y box reduced transcription by 95 % .
6,8 G#DNA|12,16 G#DNA|17,19 G#DNA|28,30 G#DNA

using supercoiled , but not linear templates , we observed differences in transcription efficiencies from templates lacking or disrupting the x consensus element that reflect effects of random replacement of x box sequences in transient expression assays .
20,23 G#DNA|30,33 G#DNA

demonstration of the complete dependence on the y box in this system suggests that , despite its demonstrated importance in the dra promoter , the dra " octamer " does not utilize otf-2 in a manner analogous to immunoglobulin promoters in b cells .

lipopolysaccharide is a potent monocyte/macrophage-specific stimulator of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression .


lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) potently stimulates human immunodeficiency virus type 1-long terminal repeat ( hiv-1-ltr ) cat constructs transfected into monocyte/macrophage-like cell lines but not a t cell line .
6,13 G#DNA|14,15 G#DNA|6,18 G#DNA|20,23 G#cell_line|26,29 G#cell_line

this effect appears to be mediated through the induction of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-kappa b ) .
10,14 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that lps induces a dna binding activity indistinguishable from nf-kappa b in u937 and thp-1 cells .
14,16 G#protein|17,18 G#cell_line|19,21 G#cell_line

lps is also shown to dramatically increase hiv-1 production from a chronically infected monocyte/macrophage-like cloned cell line , u1 , which produces very low levels of hiv-1 at baseline .
11,17 G#cell_line|18,19 G#cell_line

the stimulation of viral production from this cell line occurs only if these cells are treated with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) before treatment with lps .
17,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

this stimulation of hiv-1 production is correlated with an increase in the level of hiv-1 rna and and activation of nf-kappa b .
14,16 G#RNA|20,22 G#protein

lps is not able to induce hiv-1 production in a cloned t cell line .
11,14 G#cell_line

the effect of lps on hiv-1 replication occurs at picogram per milliliter concentrations and may be clinically significant in understanding the variability of the natural history of hiv-1 infection .


steroid dose sparing : pharmacodynamic responses to single versus divided doses of methylprednisolone in man .


inhibitory drug interactions affecting the metabolism of methylprednisolone ( mp ) may produce either steroid sparing or adverse effects partly by increasing the exposure time to the steroid .


this phenomenon can be mimicked by administering mp in divided doses .


two types of responses were compared after a single mp dose ( 40 mg bolus ) and a divided regimen ( 20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later ) in six healthy male volunteers .


the suppression of basophils measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours .
3,4 G#cell_type

the 37.5 % reduction in dose produced a 23 % overall decreased blood histamine response .


a pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of mp after both regimens .


a slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of basophil cell return to blood .
18,20 G#cell_type

the 50 % inhibitory concentrations of mp of about 5 ng/ml were similar for both regimens .


the decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between mp treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours .


the 50 % inhibitory concentrations of mp values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng/ml .


pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the " dose-sparing " effects that were achieved by prolonging mp plasma concentrations .


this study supports previous clinical observations that patients may require morning through evening exposure to mp to optimize efficacy while adrenal suppression is being minimized .


1,25(oh)2d2 production by t lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages recovered by lavage from normocalcemic patients with tuberculosis .
3,5 G#cell_type|6,8 G#cell_type

to compare extra-renal 1,25(oh)2d3 production in different types of granulomatous disease , and to identify the cell types responsible , we have evaluated the conversion of 25(oh)d3 in 1,25(oh)2d3 by uncultured cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage and blood mononuclear cells from normocalcemic patients with sarcoidosis and tuberculosis .
30,32 G#cell_type|37,40 G#cell_type

1,25(oh)2d3 was produced both by lavage cells ( 12/12 tuberculosis patients , 2/6 sarcoidosis patients ) and blood mononuclear cells ( 3/5 tuberculosis patients , 0/3 sarcoidosis patients ) from patients but not controls , but significantly greater amounts were produced by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients than those of sarcoidosis patients ( p less than 0.001 ) .
5,7 G#cell_type|17,20 G#cell_type

1,25(oh)2d3 production by lavage cells from tuberculosis patients correlated with the number of cd8+ t lymphocytes present but not other cell types .
3,5 G#cell_type|14,16 G#cell_type

t lymphocytes appeared to be an important source of 1,25(oh)2d3 production , since purified t lymphocytes from all patients with tuberculosis produced 1,25(oh)2d3 , and 1,25(oh)2d3 production by these cells correlated closely with that produced by unseparated lavage cells .
0,2 G#cell_type|14,16 G#cell_type|37,39 G#cell_type

because 1,25(oh)2d3 can improve the capacity of macrophages to kill mycobacteria , our results support the conclusion that macrophage-lymphocyte interactions , mediated at least in part by 1,25(oh)2d3 , may be an important component of a successful antituberculous immune response .
7,8 G#cell_type

megakaryocytic and erythrocytic lineages share specific transcription factors .
0,4 G#cell_line|6,8 G#protein

erythroid-specific genes contain binding sites for nf-e1 ( also called gf-1 and eryf-1 ; refs 1-3 respectively ) , the principal dna-binding protein of the erythrocytic lineage .
0,2 G#DNA|6,7 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|21,23 G#protein|25,27 G#cell_type

nf-e1 expression seems to be restricted to the erythrocytic lineage .
0,1 G#protein|8,10 G#cell_type

a closely related ( if not identical ) protein is found in both a human megakaryocytic cell line and purified human megakaryocytes ; it binds to promoter regions of two megakaryocytic-specific genes .
14,18 G#cell_line|19,22 G#cell_line|26,28 G#DNA|30,32 G#DNA

the binding sites and partial proteolysis profile of this protein are indistinguishable from those of the erythroid protein ; also , nf-e1 messenger rna is the same size in both the megakaryocytic and erythroid cell lines .
16,18 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|21,24 G#RNA|31,36 G#cell_line

furthermore , point mutations that abolish binding of nf-e1 result in a 70 % decrease in the transcriptional activity of a megakaryocytic-specific promoter .
8,9 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

we also find that nf-e2 , another trans-acting factor of the erythrocytic lineage , is present in megakaryocytes .
4,5 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|11,13 G#cell_type|17,18 G#cell_line

transcriptional effects in both lineages might then be mediated in part by the same specific trans-acting factors .
15,17 G#protein

our data strengthen the idea of a close association between the erythrocytic and the megakaryocytic lineages and could also explain the expression of markers specific to the erythrocytic and megakaryocytic lineages in most erythroblastic and megakaryoblastic permanent cell lines .
11,16 G#cell_line|27,31 G#cell_type|33,39 G#cell_line

transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc expression by protein synthesis -dependent and -independent pathways in a human t lymphoblastic tumor cell line .
3,4 G#DNA|14,20 G#cell_line

we show that in the human t lymphoblastic tumor cell line molt4 c-myc mrna and protein expression is down-regulated after exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide , to phorbol myristate acetate , or to the calcium ionophore a23187 , which raises the intracellular calcium concentration .
5,11 G#cell_line|12,13 G#DNA|11,14 G#RNA

a block to rna elongation is largely responsible for decreased c-myc transcription .
10,11 G#DNA

although negative regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide takes place even when protein synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide , the phorbol myristate acetate effect is blocked to some extent only by cycloheximide .


the calcium ionophore-induced c-myc suppression , however , strictly requires de novo protein synthesis .
3,4 G#DNA

therefore , two different negative regulatory pathways are involved in c-myc regulation : one which is independent and one which depends on de novo protein synthesis .
10,11 G#DNA

the latter one appears to be mediated by a rapidly calcium -dependent induced gene product .

oestrogen receptor ( er ) analysis in b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia : correlation of biochemical and immunocytochemical methods .
0,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein

oestrogen receptors ( er ) are present in neoplastic lymphoid cells and have been considered a physiological marker of growth rate or differentiation .
0,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein|8,11 G#cell_type

tamoxifen , an oestrogen antagonist , has been given in some patients with cll and hodgkin 's disease , with dramatic response in single cases .


until now , er status has been assessed using a steroid binding assay ( sba ) which has many inherent problems .
3,4 G#protein

recently , the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against er has been applied to the study of breast carcinomas and results obtained show good correlation with the quantitative sba .
9,10 G#protein

we studied 49 cases of b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) using immunostaining of cytospin preparations .


in 30 of these cases er enzyme immunoassay ( er -eia ) was also performed .
5,6 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

cultured mcf-7 cells , derived from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient , known to contain high levels of er were used as a positive control ( 40-48 % er positive cells by immunocytochemistry ; 200 fmol/mg protein by eia ) .
0,3 G#cell_line|21,22 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|31,34 G#cell_type

all of the cll cases except two ( 96 % ) were negative for er ( less than 1 % staining ; less than 4 fmol/mg protein ) .
14,15 G#protein

the two positive cases expressed granular er staining over the nucleus ( 9.2 and 12.1 % positive cells ) and were positive by eia and sba .
6,7 G#protein

it is concluded that ( i ) patients with cll rarely express er and ( ii ) immunocytochemical staining of cytospin preparations is a valid technique for the measurement of er .
12,13 G#protein|30,31 G#protein

it is of interest that one of the positive cases was diagnosed as cll with richter 's transformation confirming earlier findings .


type-ii estrogen binding sites in a lymphoblastoid cell line and growth-inhibitory effect of estrogen , anti-estrogen and bioflavonoids .
0,4 G#protein|6,9 G#cell_line

type-ii estrogen -binding sites ( type-ii ebs ) have been demonstrated in the human lymphoblastoid cell line im-9 using a whole-cell assay with ( 6,7-3h ) estradiol ( 3h-e2 ) as tracer .
0,4 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|14,17 G#cell_line|13,17 G#cell_line|17,18 G#cell_line

competition analysis showed that the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and the flavonoids quercetin and rutin competed for (3h)-e2 binding to type-ii ebs .
18,20 G#protein

growth experiments demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol ( des ) tamoxifen ( tam ) , quercetin and rutin exerted a reversible dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in the range of concentrations between 10 nm and 10 microm .


the relative binding affinity of quercetin , rutin , des and tam for type-ii ebs correlated well with their potency as cell growth inhibitors .
13,15 G#protein

moreover , hesperidin , a flavonoid which does not bind to type-ii ebs , was ineffective in inhibiting cell growth .
11,13 G#protein

cell-cycle analysis showed that the growth-inhibitory effect of des , tam or quercetin was due to a blocking effect in the g0-g1 phases .


our results suggest that high estrogen and anti-estrogen concentrations and flavonoids may regulate im-9 cell growth through a common mechanism involving a binding interaction with type-ii ebs .

[ glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with bronchial asthma ]
1,3 G#protein|4,7 G#cell_type

quantitation of glucocorticoid receptors ( gcr ) and the study of their affinity for glucocorticosteroids ( gcs ) were made in peripheral blood lymphocytes of bronchial asthma ( ba ) patients in consideration of gcr treatment and serum levels of endogenous cortisol .
2,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|21,24 G#cell_type|34,35 G#protein

it is stated that gcr of healthy controls and gcs -untreated patients outnumbered those of cortisol-dependent ba patients on hormone therapy .

two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human glucocorticoid receptor .
1,4 G#protein|6,9 G#protein

glucocorticoids are known to have a lytic effect in leukemic cells via interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) .
9,11 G#cell_type|15,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

cortisol and various synthetic glucocorticoids bind to the gr with one-site kinetics .
8,9 G#protein

cortivazol ( cvz ) is a unique , high potency synthetic glucocorticoid , which has a phenylpyrazol fused to the a-ring of the steroid nucleus and displays binding consistent with two or more sites in the cytosol from cem c7 cells ( a human acute lymphoblastic t-cell line ) .
38,41 G#cell_line|43,48 G#cell_line

it has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone .


the higher affinity sites bind cvz with 20- to 50-fold greater affinity , consistent with cvz 's enhanced biological effects .


in mutant leukemic cells resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone , cvz both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in cem c7 cells .
2,4 G#cell_type|31,34 G#cell_line

we have carried out experiments to define the nature of the higher affinity cvz binding site .
11,16 G#protein

we now show that : 1 ) cvz has more than one binding site in a second , independent , b-cell line , im-9 ; 2 ) the antiglucocorticoid ru 38486 is able to block both cvz 's higher and lower affinity sites ; 3 ) all of cvz 's binding sites are on a protein immunologically indistinguishable from the human gr ; and 4 ) freshly isolated clones of cvz -resistant cells have lost all binding sites for cvz .
20,22 G#cell_line|23,24 G#cell_line|48,52 G#protein|61,62 G#protein

these data indicate that cvz is recognizing two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human gr or a protein very similar to it .

in this report we describe the use of recombinant retroviruses to characterize the activity of an exogenous promoter in primary cells obtained from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders .
16,18 G#DNA

the infection of a variety of cultured and primary lymphoid cells with a recombinant retrovirus containing a histone promoter-driven beta-galactosidase gene is shown to result in the expression of beta-galactosidase in 50 % to 100 % of the cells .
8,11 G#cell_type|17,20 G#protein|17,21 G#DNA|29,30 G#protein

a similar infection with a recombinant retrovirus containing the beta-galactosidase gene with an adenovirus e2 promoter , results in beta-galactosidase activity in a limited number of cultured and primary cells .
9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#DNA|13,16 G#DNA|19,20 G#protein|26,27 G#cell_line|28,30 G#cell_type

since the adenovirus e2 promoter has been well characterized and is known to be regulated by transactivators encoded by many viruses , the activity of this promoter in specific cell types is discussed in reference to both the biology of the cell and the possible presence of as yet undetected viral gene products .

[ the effect of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( dioxyvit ) on ca metabolism and immune status during chronic kidney failure ]


active metabolite of vitamin d3 , 24r,25 (oh)2d3 ( dioxyvit ) was used at a daily dose of 100 micrograms in treatment of children affected with tubulointerstitial disease of kidney and with chronic glomerulonephritis under conditions of kidney insufficiency .


the drug exhibited distinct normalizing effect on patterns of calcium metabolism : increase of total and ionized ca2+ and of 25-ohd , decrease in concentration of parath hormone and osteocalcine in blood serum as well as on immunological parameters : restoration of decreased content of t- and 0- lymphocytes .
45,49 G#cell_type

concentration of receptors of hormonal form of 1,25(oh)2d3 was found to be minimal in lymphocytes under conditions of chronic kidney insufficiency , while their expression , after the dioxyvit action , was detected only in patients with glomerulonephritis .
14,15 G#cell_type

specific calcitropic effect of dioxyvit with simultaneous correction of vitamin d deficiency were apparently responsible for high efficacy of the drug in treatment of calcium metabolism and immunity impairments in children with renal deteriorations at the step of chronic kidney insufficiency .


[ the role of glucocorticoid receptors and hla antigens in the pathogenesis of cushing 's syndrome ]
4,6 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|13,16 G#protein

lymphocytic levels of glucocorticoid receptors were evaluated in 114 patients suffering from icenko- cushing 's syndrome .
3,5 G#protein|13,16 G#protein

incidence of hla antigens was determined in 94 of them .
2,4 G#protein

a significant rise of a10 and b27 antigen incidence compared to that in normal subjects allows these antigens to be considered genetic markers of icenko- cushing 's syndrome .
4,5 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|25,28 G#protein

the levels of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of the patients are lower than in normal subjects both in the active stage of the disease and following bilateral total adrenalectomy .
3,5 G#protein|6,7 G#cell_type

the patients carrying b27 antigen had lymphocytic receptor concentrations under the levels of such in patients free of the antigen carriage .
3,5 G#protein

effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 on the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line rwleu-4 .
9,15 G#cell_line|15,16 G#cell_line

the effects of 1 alpha , 25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( vd3 ) on proliferation , differentiation , and macromolecular synthesis in the new philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line , rwleu-4 , were investigated .
22,29 G#cell_line|30,31 G#cell_line

binding of [3h]vd3 was saturable , with approximately 2000-3000 sites/cell , and half-maximal binding occurring at 0.21-0.33 nm .


treatment of rwleu-4 cells with vd3 induced 24r-hydroxylase activity , a marker of vitamin d3 responsiveness in many tissues .

exposure of rwleu-4 cells to vd3 also inhibited proliferation and dna synthesis with a 50 % effective dose of 3.5-10 nm within 72 h ; in addition , protein and rna synthesis were inhibited by vd3 treatment .
2,4 G#cell_line

exposure of rwleu-4 cells to 5 nm vd3 for 72 h caused 50 % of the cells to differentiate into macrophage/monocyte type cells as judged by nitroblue tetrazolium staining and adherence to plastic .
2,4 G#cell_line|20,23 G#cell_type

progressive expression of cell surface maturation-specific antigens of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was induced by treatment of rwleu-4 cells with vd3 for 24 to 72 h at doses that inhibited cellular proliferation .
3,7 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_type|16,18 G#cell_line

c-myc rna , which is constitutively expressed in rwleu-4 cells , increased after 0.5 h of treatment with 50 nm vd3 and then rapidly decreased to barely detectable levels after 4 h of treatment .
0,2 G#RNA|8,10 G#cell_line

finally , the in vitro tyrosine kinase activity associated with the p210bcr-abl oncogene product was decreased approximately 50 % by vd3 treatment .
11,13 G#DNA|11,14 G#protein

because of the presence of a functional receptor-effector system for vd3 and multiple biological responses to the hormone , these cells provide a unique model system with which to probe the specific effects of vd3 on cell growth and differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia .


a new member of the leucine zipper class of proteins that binds to the hla dr alpha promoter .
5,7 G#protein|5,8 G#protein|14,18 G#DNA

several mutants derived from transformed human b cell lines are defective in expressing major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii genes .
4,9 G#cell_line|13,22 G#DNA

the failure to express a class ii gene in at least one such mutant line has been mapped to the mhc class ii x box , a conserved transcriptional element in the promoter region .
5,8 G#DNA|13,15 G#cell_line|20,25 G#DNA|27,30 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA

a complementary dna encoding a dna-binding protein ( human x box binding protein , hxbp-1 ) whose target is the human dr alpha x box and the 3' flanking region has now been cloned .
1,3 G#DNA|5,7 G#protein|8,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|20,25 G#DNA|27,30 G#DNA

this complementary dna encoded a protein with structural similarities to the c-jun proto-oncogene product , and its target sequence was closely related to the palindromic target sequence of c-jun .
1,3 G#DNA|11,14 G#protein|24,27 G#DNA|28,29 G#DNA

mutation of the hxbp-1 dna target sequence decreased dr alpha promoter activity in vivo .
3,4 G#protein|3,7 G#DNA|8,11 G#DNA

these studies suggest that the hxbp-1 protein acts as a transcription factor in b cells .

pseudohypoaldosteronism in eight families : different forms of inheritance are evidence for various genetic defects .


pseudohypoaldosteronism is a rare hereditary disorder presenting in early infancy with renal salt loss leading to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia despite high levels of plasma aldosterone .


the patients are insensitive to mineralocorticoids ; however , sodium supplementation is able to correct electrolyte abnormalities .


absent or greatly diminished type i aldosterone receptors in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes have been recently demonstrated and explain the lack of response to mineralocorticoids .
5,8 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_type

we have studied the mode of inheritance in eight families with a total of nine patients .


there was evidence for an autosomal recessive form of inheritance in four families , while the other four families appeared to have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission .


in three families the autosomal recessive form was characterized by normal receptor as well as hormone data in both parents , while in one family receptor levels in both parents were greatly reduced , but hormone levels were normal .
10,12 G#protein

in the four families with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission there was always one parent with reduced receptor binding in peripheral mononuclear leucocytes and elevated serum hormone levels .
21,24 G#cell_type

these parents were entirely asymptomatic .


in an extended family we were able to study an aunt and her newborn daughter , who were both also biochemically affected but clinically asymptomatic .


it , therefore , appears that this dual pattern of genetic transmission may indicate differing genetic defects which cause the same clinical picture of pseudohypoaldosteronism .


perceived social support and tumor estrogen/progesterone receptor status as predictors of natural killer cell activity in breast cancer patients .
5,7 G#protein|11,14 G#cell_type|11,15 G#protein

this report is concerned with the prediction of natural killer ( nk ) cell activity in 61 stage i and ii breast cancer patients , between the ages of 25 and 70 , who were accrued to this project .
9,14 G#cell_type

all baseline interview and testing data were obtained either just before patients were discharged from the hospital , or at their first outpatient visit , within two weeks of discharge .


a major interest of this project is the predictive value of perceived social support , as a potential " stress " buffer , related to nk activity .


in the main model reported here , we found that a significant amount of nk activity variance could be explained by five variables .


higher nk activity could be predicted by the perception of high quality emotional support from a spouse or intimate other , perceived social support from the patient 's physician , estrogen receptor -negative tumor status , having an excisional biopsy as surgical treatment , and actively seeking social support as a major coping strategy ( r2 = 0.33 , f ( 5 , 55 ) = 5.5 , p less than 0.0004 ) .
30,32 G#protein|38,40 G#protein|41,43 G#protein|47,49 G#protein

findings are discussed in terms of host interaction with tumor endocrine status , and the role that social support might play in modulating such activity .

[ estrogen receptor content of peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ]
1,3 G#protein|5,8 G#cell_type

er content in lymphocytes of peripheral blood from 27 sle patients and 20 healthy controls were determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay .
3,4 G#cell_type

er content in lymphocytes of each sample was expressed by both fmol/mg of lymphocyte cytosolic protein and fmol/micrograms of lymphocyte dna .
0,1 G#protein|3,4 G#cell_type|13,16 G#protein|19,21 G#DNA

the results showed that there was no significant difference between the er content of lymphocytes from the controls and that from patients with sle .
11,12 G#protein|14,15 G#cell_type

but the logarithmic mean of er content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/mg of cytosolic protein , in 14 patients with active sle ( 0.9356 +/- 0.31 ) was significantly higher than that in 13 patients with inactive sle ( 0.2979 +/- 0.23 , p less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 0.6204 +/- 0.52 , p less than 0.001 ) .
5,6 G#protein|8,9 G#cell_type|14,16 G#protein

the normal upper limit of er content in lymphocytes , expressed by fmol/micrograms of dna , was 0.136 .
5,6 G#protein|8,9 G#cell_type

the elevated rate of er content in lymphocytes in 14 active sle ( 92.9 % ) was also higher than that in quieiescent patients ( 23.1 % , p less than 0.001 ) and in the controls ( 10 % , p less than 0.001 ) .
4,5 G#protein|7,8 G#cell_type

moreover , the elevated level of er content was found to be related to the positive antidsdna antibody and hypocomplementemia .

an in vitro globin gene switching model based on differentiated embryonic stem cells .
3,5 G#DNA|9,13 G#cell_type

we used mouse embryonic stem ( es ) cells to study globin gene expression and switching in vitro .
2,9 G#cell_type|11,13 G#DNA

we show that es-derived embryoid bodies express the full complement of mouse embryonic globin genes in the correct temporal order and that on further differentiation , a switch occurs to the fetal/adult genes .
3,6 G#cell_type|11,15 G#DNA|31,33 G#DNA

in addition , the erythroid-specific transcription factor nf-e1 was shown to be expressed coordinately with that of globin in embryoid bodies .
4,7 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|19,21 G#cell_type

we conclude from these experiments that the es cell system provides a good model to study hematopoietic development .


when the human epsilon- or beta- globin genes driven by the dominant control region ( dcr ) are introduced into this system , the human epsilon- globin gene , in contrast to the beta- globin gene , is not deregulated by the presence of the dcr and is expressed strictly as an embryonic gene .
2,8 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA|15,16 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA|34,36 G#DNA|33,36 G#DNA|45,46 G#DNA|52,54 G#DNA

we conclude from this that the epsilon- globin gene is not regulated by competition with other genes in the human beta-globin locus .

cloning of a mitogen-inducible gene encoding a kappa b dna-binding protein with homology to the rel oncogene and to cell-cycle motifs .
3,5 G#DNA|7,11 G#protein|15,17 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA

we have cloned and characterized a mitogen-inducible gene isolated from human t cells that predicts a protein of 968 amino acids .
6,8 G#DNA|10,13 G#cell_type|18,21 G#protein

the amino-terminal domain has regions homologous to the oncogene rel and to the developmentally important gene dorsal of drosophila .
1,3 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA|16,17 G#DNA

the carboxy-terminal domain contains repeat structures found in a variety of proteins that are involved in cell-cycle control of yeast and in tissue differentiation in drosophila and ceanorhabditis elegans , as well as in the putative human oncogene bcl-3 and in the ankyrin protein .
1,3 G#protein|35,39 G#DNA|42,44 G#protein

a truncated form of the product of this gene translated in vitro is a dna-binding protein which interacts specifically with the kappa b binding site found in many inducible genes , including the enhancer in human immunodeficiency virus .
14,16 G#protein|21,25 G#DNA|28,30 G#DNA

this gene is yet another in a growing list of important regulatory molecules whose expression is transcriptionally induced upon cellular activation .


extrarenal receptor-effector-mechanisms for aldosterone : the sequence of effects on the cellular electrolyte transport in human lymphocytes and their implications for disorders of the water and electrolyte balances .
16,17 G#cell_type|15,17 G#cell_type

high affinity aldosterone binding sites have not only been described in the classic target tissues such as the renal tubules , but also in non-classic target tissues such as the hippocampus , mammary gland , endothelial cells and , recently , human mononuclear leukocytes .
35,37 G#cell_type|41,44 G#cell_type

an in vitro effect of aldosterone on intracellular sodium , potassium and calcium concentrations and cell volume was shown in human mononuclear leukocytes .
20,23 G#cell_type

in the absence of aldosterone , the intracellular na+ , k+ and ca2+ concentrations and the cell volume decreased significantly , but remained constant when aldosterone ( 1.4 nmol/l ) was added to the incubation medium .


these effects of aldosterone were blocked by the aldosterone antagonist canrenone ( 140 nmol/l ) .


the sodium/proton exchanger of the cell membrane could be identified as the primary target of the aldosterone action , possibly non-genomically mediated through membrane receptors .
1,3 G#protein|23,25 G#protein

the clinical significance of this model was underlined by the demonstration of absent or a decreased number of mineralocorticoid receptors and the lack of electrolyte response to aldosterone in human mononuclear leukocytes of patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism and aldosteronism .
18,20 G#protein|29,32 G#cell_type

additionally , an abnormal effector mechanism could be demonstrated in human mononuclear leukocytes from essential hypertensives .
10,13 G#cell_type

these studies are the first to demonstrate the significance of extrarenal , nonepithelial mineralocorticoid receptors and the related effector mechanism in different disorders of the water and electrolyte balance in man .

immunohistochemical study of steroid hormones and an estrogen binding assay in malignant soft tissue tumors .
11,15 G#cell_type

immunohistochemically , the immunoreaction against 5 steroid hormone anti-sera ( estradiol , estriol , cortisol , progesterone and testosterone ) was examined in 39 cases with the malignant soft tissue tumors ( fibrosarcoma : 8 , malignant fibrous histiocytoma : 6 , rhabdomyosarcoma : 10 , leiomyosarcoma : 10 , liposarcoma : 5 ) .
27,31 G#cell_type

seventeen cases revealed distinct immunostaining against at least 1 of the 5 steroid hormones .


immunostained tumor cells were more frequently distributed in the area where tumor cell infiltration was more invasive .
0,3 G#cell_type

the majority of the positive cases occurred in female cases .


furthermore , the existence of estrogen receptor ( estrogen binding activity ) was examined histochemically in 39 cases and it was detected in 8 .
5,7 G#protein

we concluded that steroid hormones might be closely related to tumor cell infiltration of some malignant soft tissue tumors .

involvement of cyclic amp-dependent protein kinases in the signal transduction pathway for interleukin-1 .
2,6 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

expression of a highly specific protein inhibitor for cyclic amp-dependent protein kinases in interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) -responsive cells blocked il-1-induced gene transcription that was driven by the kappa immunoglobulin enhancer or the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat .
8,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|13,19 G#cell_line|20,22 G#DNA|28,31 G#DNA|33,39 G#DNA

this inhibitor did not affect protein kinase c -mediated gene transcription , suggesting that cyclic amp-dependent protein kinases are involved in the signal transduction pathway for il-1 in a number of responsive cell types .

the epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) ori1yt enhancer is not b-cell specific and does not respond synergistically to the ebv transcription factors r and z .
1,8 G#DNA|19,25 G#protein

the epstein-barr virus dr promoter is located upstream of the psti repeats , and in addition to the tata box , it contains an upstream region ( positions -69 to -220 ) responsive to eb1 (z) ( the bzlf1-encoded transcription factor ) and an enhancer with two functionally distinct domains , a and b .
1,5 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA|24,26 G#DNA|34,36 G#protein|38,41 G#protein|44,45 G#DNA|51,52 G#DNA|53,54 G#DNA

domain b has been described as a b-cell-specific eb1 -responsive element ( p.m.lieberman , j.m.hardwick , and s.d.hayward , j.virol.63 : 3040-3050 , 1989 ) activated synergistically by eb1 and r , an ebv early product encoded by the open reading frame brlf1 ( m.a. cox , j.leahy , and j.m.hardwick , j.virol.64 : 313-321 , 1990 ) .
0,2 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|7,11 G#DNA|28,29 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|33,36 G#protein|42,43 G#DNA|39,43 G#DNA

we show here that domain b is an r-responsive element in hela cells and is therefore not an eb1 -responsive b-cell-specific element .
4,6 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|11,13 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|18,22 G#DNA

however , there is an eb1 -binding site ( zre-b ) located within the r-responsive enhancer region .
5,6 G#protein|5,8 G#DNA|9,10 G#DNA|14,17 G#DNA

zre-b can be deleted without affecting the r-dependent enhancer activity .
0,1 G#DNA

moreover , there is no cooperation or synergy between r and eb1 when activating the b domain ( zre-b plus the r-responsive element ) positioned as an enhancer .
9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|15,17 G#DNA|18,19 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA|27,28 G#DNA

zre-b is therefore not part of the r- inducible enhancer .
0,1 G#DNA|7,9 G#DNA

we have tested several subregions of the dr enhancer b domain , either alone or in combination , for their capacity to transmit the r-activating signal to the rabbit beta-globin promoter .
7,9 G#DNA|9,11 G#DNA|28,31 G#DNA

we found that the r-responsive element is composed of four protoenhancers that span the whole b domain .
4,6 G#DNA|10,11 G#DNA|15,17 G#DNA

these protoenhancers alone are weakly or not responsive to r .
1,2 G#DNA|9,10 G#protein

one of the protoenhancers contains the overlapping palindromes 5'-ttgtcccgtggacaaatgtcc-3' .
3,4 G#DNA|6,8 G#DNA

however , one palindrome , either alone or duplicated , or the overlapping palindromes did not respond to r .

nuclear 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine receptors ( t3r ) of circulating human lymphocytes in hyper- and hypo thyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases .
1,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|9,10 G#cell_type|7,10 G#cell_type

the clinical implications of nuclear t3r alterations of circulating lymphocytes in hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and nonthyroidal diseases were investigated .
5,6 G#protein|9,10 G#cell_type|8,10 G#cell_type

nuclear t3r in lymphocytes was determined by radio-ligand binding analysis .
1,2 G#protein|3,4 G#cell_type

the results showed that in hyper- and hypo thyroid patients the nuclear affinity ( ka ) for t3 was similar to that of normal subjects .


in hyperthyroidism nuclear t3 maximal binding capacity ( mbc ) was unaltered , whereas in hypothyroidism the mbc was significantly increased .


in the patients with diabetes mellitus , chronic renal failure and hepatic cirrhosis , the nuclear t3r mbc of lymphocytes was about 1.5-1.6 times of the normal controls .
16,17 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|19,20 G#cell_type

it was concluded that there existed hormonal regulation of nuclear t3r , and up-regulation was seen in hypothyroidism and low t3 syndrome .

lymphocyte cell lines from vitamin d-dependent rickets type ii show functional defects in the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 receptor .
0,3 G#cell_line|14,18 G#protein

lymphocyte cell lines were established from five patients with vitamin d-dependent rickets , type ii ( vddr-ii ) .
0,3 G#cell_line

these lines were established by infection with human t-lymphotrophic virus type i ( htlv-i ) .


binding of [3h]1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( 1,25(oh)2d3 ) to its receptor in these cell lines was compared to binding studies using a t-lymphocyte cell line ( s-lb1 ) from a normal individual .
22,25 G#cell_line|26,27 G#cell_line

the 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor of s-lb1 was comparable to the well-characterized chick intestinal 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor in terms of its ligand binding affinity and capacity , its mobility on 5-20 % sucrose gradients , and its adsorption to and elution properties from dna-cellulose .
4,5 G#cell_line|10,14 G#protein

three cell lines established from patients with vddr-ii ( rh- vdr , sh- vdr , and ab- vdr ) showed no specific binding of 1,25(oh)2d3 to a receptor and treatment of the cultured cells with 1,25(oh)2d3 did not stimulate production of 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin d3 ( 24,25(oh)2d3 ) , a response which is diagnostic of the presence of a functional 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor .
1,3 G#cell_line|10,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|32,34 G#cell_line|57,60 G#protein

in a fourth cell line , a1-vdr , the receptor for 1,25(oh)2d3 had a low binding capacity and 25(oh)d3-24-hydroxylase activity was not detectable .
3,5 G#cell_line|6,7 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein

induction of 24,25-(oh)2d3 synthesis by 1,25(oh)2d3 was observed in the fifth cell line , designated ro-vdr , although the sensitivity to hormone treatment was lower than in the control cell line from a normal donor .
11,13 G#cell_line|15,16 G#cell_line|28,31 G#cell_line

the capacity of the receptor for 1,25(oh)2d3 was low in ro-vdr .
4,5 G#protein|10,11 G#cell_line

in all cell lines where 1,25(oh)2d3 binding to a receptor was detectable , the receptor had the typical sedimentation coefficient of 3.7 s on sucrose density gradient analysis .
2,4 G#cell_line|9,10 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

binding and elution properties to dna-cellulose , however , differed from normal in both ro-vdr and a1-vdr cells where elution from dna-cellulose occurred at a lower salt concentration than is typical of the 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor .
14,15 G#cell_line|16,17 G#cell_line|16,18 G#cell_line|34,35 G#protein|33,35 G#protein

while ro-vdr cells showed typical nuclear localization of the unoccupied 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor , neither the unoccupied nor the occupied receptor from a1-vdr cells was completely localized in the nucleus .
1,2 G#cell_line|1,3 G#cell_line|11,12 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#cell_line|21,23 G#cell_line

in a series of functional studies we found that modulation of the level of the mrnas coding for both the c-myc oncogene and the growth factor known as granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating activity by 1,25(oh)2d3 correlated with the 1,25(oh)2d3 receptor status of these cells .
15,16 G#RNA|20,22 G#DNA|38,39 G#protein|37,39 G#protein|37,39 G#protein

use of these cell lines will facilitate further study of the molecular defect ( s ) in the receptor for 1,25(oh)2d3 in vitamin d-dependent rickets type ii and will allow a correlation with impairment of cellular functions .

transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of c-jun expression during monocytic differentiation of human myeloid leukemic cells .
5,6 G#DNA|11,15 G#cell_line

ap-1 , the polypeptide product of c-jun , recognizes and binds to specific dna sequences and stimulates transcription of genes responsive to certain growth factors and phorbol esters such as 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( tpa ) .
0,1 G#protein|6,7 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA|19,20 G#DNA

we studied the effects of tpa on the regulation of c-jun gene expression in hl-60 cells during monocytic differentiation .
10,11 G#DNA|14,16 G#cell_line

low levels of c-jun transcripts were detectable in untreated hl-60 leukemic cells , increased significantly by 6 h , and reached near maximal levels by 24 h of exposure to 32 nm tpa .
3,4 G#DNA|3,5 G#RNA|8,12 G#cell_line

similar kinetics of c-jun induction by tpa were observed in human u-937 and thp-1 monocytic leukemia cells .
3,4 G#DNA|10,12 G#cell_line|13,17 G#cell_line

similar findings were obtained with bryostatin 1 ( 10 nm ) , another activator of protein kinase c and inducer of monocytic differentiation .
15,18 G#protein

furthermore , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( 0.5 microm ) , a structurally distinct agent which also induces hl-60 monocytic differentiation , increased c-jun expression .
21,22 G#DNA

tpa treatment of hl-60 cells in the presence of cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of c-jun transcripts .
3,5 G#cell_line|15,16 G#DNA

run-on analysis demonstrated detectable levels of c-jun gene transcription in untreated hl-60 cells , and that exposure to tpa increases this rate 3.3-fold .
6,7 G#DNA|11,13 G#cell_line|10,13 G#cell_line

treatment of hl-60 cells with both tpa and cycloheximide had no effect on the rates of c-jun transcription .
2,4 G#cell_line|16,17 G#DNA

the half-life of c-jun rna as determined by treating hl-60 cells with tpa and actinomycin d was 30 min .
3,4 G#DNA|3,5 G#RNA|9,11 G#cell_line

in contrast , the half-life of c-jun rna in tpa -treated hl-60 cells exposed to cycloheximide and actinomycin d was greater than 2 h .
6,7 G#DNA|6,8 G#RNA|11,13 G#cell_line|9,13 G#cell_line

these findings suggested that the increase in c-jun rna observed during tpa -induced monocytic differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms .

4,6 G#protein

as many as 27 children aged 6 to 15 years with morphologically verified nephropathies were examined .


four variants of changes in the thyroid status , characteristic of children with different variants of nephrotic syndrome were distinguished : 1 ) biochemical signs of primary hypothyroidism , 2 ) biochemical signs of secondary hypothyroidism , 3 ) low content of t3 , 4 ) dysfunction of the hypophyseal and thyroid system .


it is shown that the low level of steroid receptors , thyroid hormones that the low level of steroid receptors , thyroid hormones ( t3 and t4 ) and cortisol is typical of children with the signs of renal dysplasia .
8,10 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

it is assumed that superaddition under such conditions of immune glomerulopathy ( glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome ) gives rise to the resistance to the treatment with glucocorticoids .


lymphoid specific gene expression of the adenovirus early region 3 promoter is mediated by nf-kappa b binding motifs .

a primary site of infection by human adenoviruses is lymphoid cells .

however , analysis of the viral control elements and the cellular factors that regulate adenoviral gene expression in lymphocytes has not been reported .
5,8 G#DNA|10,12 G#protein|18,19 G#cell_type

the adenovirus early region 3 ( es ) gene products are involved in the maintenance of viral persistence by complexing with the class i mhc antigens , thus preventing their cell surface expression with a resultant decrease in host immunologic destruction .

to determine whether different cellular factors were involved in e3 regulation in lymphocytes as compared with hela cells , both dna binding and transfection analysis with the e3 promoter in both cell types were performed .
4,6 G#protein|12,13 G#cell_type|16,18 G#cell_line|27,29 G#DNA

these studies detected two novel domains referred to as l1 and l2 with a variety of lymphoid but not hela extracts .
4,6 G#DNA|9,10 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA

each of these domains possessed strong homology to motifs previously found to bind the cellular factor nf-kappa b .
16,18 G#protein|14,18 G#protein

transfections of e3 constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene revealed that mutagenesis of the distal nf-kappa b motif ( l2 ) had minimal effects on promoter expression in hela cells , but resulted in dramatic decreases in expression by lymphoid cells .

in contrast , mutagenesis of proximal nf-kappa b motif ( l1 ) had minimal effects on gene expression in both hela cells and lymphoid cells but resulted in a small , but reproducible , increase in gene expression in lymphoid cells when coupled to the l2 mutation .
5,9 G#DNA|10,11 G#DNA|20,22 G#cell_line|23,25 G#cell_type|39,41 G#cell_type|45,46 G#DNA

reversing the position and subsequent mutagenesis of the l1 and l2 domains indicated that the primary sequence of these motifs rather than their position in the e3 promoter was critical for regulating gene expression .

characterization of defensin resistance phenotypes associated with mutations in the phop virulence regulon of salmonella typhimurium .
2,3 G#protein|10,13 G#DNA

the defensin sensitivities of salmonella typhimurium strains with mutations in the phop/phoq two-component virulence regulon were tested by using purified defensins np-1 and np-2 .
1,2 G#protein|11,15 G#DNA|19,21 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

strains with mutations in either gene of the regulatory pair ( phop [ transcriptional activator ] or phoq [ membrane sensor kinase ] ) had increased sensitivities to defensin .
8,10 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA|17,18 G#DNA|19,22 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

the predicted periplasmic domain of the phoq protein contained a markedly anionic domain that could interact with cationic proteins and that could be responsible for resistance to defensin .
2,4 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|27,28 G#protein

because insertion mutations in phop are polar on phoq , we constructed strains that expressed the phoq protein in the absence of phop to test whether resistance to defensin requires only the phoq gene product .
4,5 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|16,18 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|32,33 G#DNA|32,35 G#protein

we found that resistance to defensin requires the function of both components of this regulatory system , because strains expressing phoq without phop were still markedly sensitive to defensins .
20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

this implied that a pag ( phop -activated gene ) product is responsible for defensin resistance .
4,5 G#DNA|6,7 G#DNA|6,9 G#DNA|4,11 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

we also tested for the ability of defensins np-1 , np-5 , and hnp-1 to activate pag expression and found that these peptides have no effect .
7,8 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|16,17 G#DNA

defensin resistance is not the only virulence characteristic controlled by the phop -phoq regulon because mutations in pagc , as well as ones in the phop locus that resulted in constitutive pag activation ( phenotype phopc ) , had no effect on defensin resistance , even though they rendered the organism avirulent and deficient in survival within macrophages .
11,12 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|17,18 G#DNA|25,26 G#DNA|25,27 G#DNA|31,32 G#DNA|35,36 G#protein|42,43 G#protein|57,58 G#cell_type

the virulence defect conferred by mutations in the phop -phoq two-component regulatory system is not completely explained by alterations in resistance to cationic proteins and involves the control of other proteins necessary for s. typhimurium survival within macrophages .

stimulation of a human t-cell clone with anti-cd3 or tumor necrosis factor induces nf-kappa b translocation but not human immunodeficiency virus 1 enhancer-dependent transcription .
3,6 G#cell_line|7,8 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|13,15 G#protein

the expression of transiently transfected expression vectors under the control of the long terminal repeat ( ltr ) of the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) or its enhancer sequence and the translocation of the hiv enhancer-binding protein nf-kappa b were analyzed in two human t-cell clones stimulated through their t-cell receptor complex or by tumor necrosis factor or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .
12,15 G#DNA|16,17 G#DNA|28,30 G#DNA|35,38 G#protein|38,40 G#protein|45,47 G#cell_line|50,53 G#protein|55,58 G#protein

we found a dissociation of nf-kappa b translocation from transactivation of either the hiv ltr or the hiv enhancer .
5,7 G#protein|13,15 G#DNA|17,19 G#DNA

interleukin 2 induced proliferation but not nf-kappa b translocation or ltr transactivation .
0,2 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|10,11 G#DNA

phorbol ester or specific antigen recognition induced hiv ltr transactivation , whereas stimulation with tumor necrosis factor or antibody to cd3 did not .
7,9 G#DNA|14,17 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

the two latter signals were nevertheless able to induce nf-kappa b translocation with a pattern in the band-shift assay indistinguishable from that observed using phorbol ester .
9,11 G#protein

our finding that induction of nf-kappa b by tumor necrosis factor or antibody to cd3 is not sufficient to induce hiv enhancer -dependent transcription in cloned t cells contrasts with results obtained in most lymphoblastoid t-cell lines and indicates that normal t lymphocytes differ from tumoral t cells in terms of requirements for hiv ltr activation .
5,7 G#protein|8,11 G#protein|12,15 G#protein|20,22 G#DNA|25,28 G#cell_line|34,37 G#cell_line|42,43 G#cell_type|41,43 G#cell_type|45,48 G#cell_type|53,55 G#DNA

furthermore , our results suggest that events linked to t-cell activation , in addition to nf-kappa b translocation per se , induce functional interactions of the nf-kappa b complex with the hiv enhancer .

decreased concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 receptors in peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets : effect of phosphate supplementation .
3,6 G#protein|7,10 G#cell_type

abnormal renal tubular phosphate transport is considered to be the primary defect in x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets ( xlh ) .


however , the resistance to vitamin d treatment in xlh can not be explained by hypophosphatemia alone .


since most of the actions of vitamin d are mediated by its receptors ( vdr ) , abnormalities of vdr have been postulated in xlh .
14,15 G#protein|19,20 G#protein

in order to investigate this possibility , we measured the concentration of vdr in pha-activated peripheral mononuclear cells from 10 xlh patients .
12,13 G#protein|15,18 G#cell_type|14,18 G#cell_line

patients without phosphate supplementation showed significantly lower concentration ( 21.7 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein , mean +/- sem ) compared to the normal controls ( 60.7 +/- 4.0 ) .


on the contrary , there was no significant difference between the phosphate-supplemented patients ( 58.3 +/- 2.7 ) and controls .


there was a significant positive correlation between vdr concentration and serum phosphate ( p less than 0.05 ) .
7,8 G#protein

in two patients , vdr was increased after daily phosphate supplementation was started .
4,5 G#protein

these results indicate that a decreased concentration of vdr secondary to persistent hypophosphatemia is one of the causes of vitamin d resistance in xlh .
8,9 G#protein

two distinct forms of active transcription factor creb ( camp response element binding protein ) .
4,8 G#protein|9,14 G#protein

mammalian cells express two distinct forms of transcription factor creb ( camp response element binding protein ) that are apparently the products of alternative splicing of the creb gene transcript .
0,2 G#cell_type|9,10 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|11,16 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|27,30 G#RNA

the two proteins differ by a 14-amino acid serine-rich insertion present in one of the creb isoforms .
6,10 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

we show that both creb isoforms are expressed in many cell types and mammalian species .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_type

both encode proteins that bind specifically to a camp response element in vitro .
8,13 G#DNA

as expected for proteins of this class , the creb proteins bind dna as dimers .
9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#protein

both proteins impart camp -regulated transcriptional activity to a heterologous dna-binding domain , showing that camp directly modulates the transcriptional stimulatory activity of creb .
9,12 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein

the presence of multiple creb isoforms with identical dna-binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that creb proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription .

human immunodeficiency virus vpr product is a virion-associated regulatory protein .
0,5 G#protein|7,10 G#protein

the vpr product of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) acts in trans to accelerate virus replication and cytopathic effect in t cells .
1,3 G#protein|24,26 G#cell_type

here it is shown that the hiv-1 viral particle contains multiple copies of the vpr protein .
14,16 G#protein

the vpr product is the first regulatory protein of hiv-1 to be found in the virus particle .
1,3 G#protein

this observation raises the possibility that vpr acts to facilitate the early steps of infection before de novo viral protein synthesis occurs .
6,7 G#DNA

a novel b-cell lineage-specific transcription factor present at early but not late stages of differentiation .
2,6 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

a novel b-cell-specific transcription factor , bsap , was identified as a mammalian homolog of the sea urchin protein tsap , which interacts with the promoters of four tissue-specific late histone h2a-2 and h2b-2 genes .
2,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|16,19 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|25,26 G#DNA|28,35 G#DNA

as shown by mobility-shift , methylation interference , and mutational analyses , the mammalian protein bsap recognizes all four sea urchin binding sites in a manner indistinguishable from tsap ; however , the two proteins differ in molecular weight .
13,15 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|19,23 G#DNA|28,29 G#protein

bsap is exclusively restricted to the b-cell lineage of lymphoid differentiation .
0,1 G#protein

its expression appears to be activated during pro-b-cell development , is abundant at the pre-b- and mature b- cell stages , but is absent in terminally differentiated plasma cells .
25,29 G#cell_type

moreover , bsap is clearly a b-cell-specific transcription factor , as a wild-type but not a mutant tsap -binding site of the sea urchin functions only in transfected b cells as an upstream promoter element .
2,3 G#protein|6,9 G#protein|12,13 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|16,20 G#DNA|27,30 G#cell_line|32,35 G#DNA

competition experiments did not reveal any high-affinity binding site for bsap in known regulatory regions of immunoglobulin and class ii major histocompatibility ( mhc ) genes , suggesting that bsap is a regulator of a different set of b-lymphoid-specific genes .

octamer transcription factors and the cell type-specificity of immunoglobulin gene expression .
0,3 G#protein|5,10 G#DNA

antibodies are produced exclusively in b lymphocytes .
0,1 G#protein|6,7 G#cell_type|5,7 G#cell_type

the expression of the antibody-encoding genes , the immunoglobulin ( ig ) genes , is also restricted to b cells .
4,6 G#DNA|8,13 G#DNA|18,20 G#cell_type

the octamer sequence atgcaaat is present in the promoter and the enhancer of ig genes , and plays an important role in its tissue-specific expression .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA

this sequence motif is a binding site for nuclear proteins , the so-called octamer transcription factors ( oct or otf factors ) .
1,3 G#DNA|8,10 G#protein|13,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

the oct-1 protein is present in all cell types analyzed so far , whereas oct-2a and oct-2b are found mainly in b lymphocytes .
1,3 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|22,23 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_type

all three proteins show the same sequence specificity and binding affinity .


it appears that the b cell-specific expression of ig genes is mediated at least in part by cell type-specific oct factors , and that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between oct-1 and oct-2 factors .
8,10 G#DNA|18,21 G#protein|32,33 G#protein|34,36 G#protein

recently , a number of other octamer factor variants were identified .
6,9 G#protein

many of these may be created by alternative splicing of a primary transcript of one oct factor gene and may serve a specific function in the fine tuning of gene expression .
11,13 G#RNA

a factor known to bind to endogenous ig heavy chain enhancer only in lymphocytes is a ubiquitously active transcription factor .
6,11 G#DNA|13,14 G#cell_type|16,20 G#protein

the transcriptional enhancer located in the first intron of the immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region is a major determinant of b-cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes .
1,3 G#DNA|10,15 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA

like other enhancers , the ig heavy chain enhancer contains several short sequence motifs that bind specific transcription factors .
2,3 G#DNA|5,9 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|16,19 G#protein

each binding site contributes to the overall activity of the enhancer , however no single element seems absolutely required for activity .
1,3 G#DNA|10,11 G#DNA

for a better understanding of the ig heavy chain enhancer components , we have cloned and analyzed individual sequence elements .
6,10 G#DNA|6,11 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA

we find that the factor that binds to the e3 enhancer motif , catgtggc , is a ubiquitous transcription factor .
9,12 G#DNA|17,20 G#protein

it is present in an active form in both b cells and non- b cells , where it can mediate transcriptional activation in vitro and in vivo .
9,11 G#cell_type|13,15 G#cell_type|12,15 G#cell_type

however , despite its ability to activate transcription of a transfected reporter gene , the factor is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous ig heavy chain enhancer in non- lymphoid cells : in previous experiments by others , the characteristic in vivo footprint of this factor , designated nf-mue3 , was detected in b cells but not in non-b cells .
10,13 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA|23,28 G#DNA|30,32 G#cell_type|29,32 G#cell_type|49,50 G#protein|54,56 G#cell_type|59,61 G#cell_type

from this and other findings the picture emerges that there are at least three categories of factors which mediate cell-type-specific transcription in b lymphocytes : ( a ) cell-specific factors such as oct-2a and oct-2b that are not expressed in most other cell types : ( b ) ubiquitous factors such as nf-kappa b that are constitutively active in b cells but are sequestered in an inactive form in other cells ; ( c ) ubiquitously active factors , exemplified by the one binding to the e3 sequence motif .
23,24 G#cell_type|22,24 G#cell_type|28,30 G#protein|32,33 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|48,50 G#protein|52,54 G#protein|59,61 G#cell_type|75,78 G#protein|86,89 G#DNA

this factor is present in an active form in a variety of cell types but is apparently unable to bind to the endogenous ig heavy chain enhancer in non-b cells , perhaps due to a non-permissive chromatin structure of the ig heavy chain locus .

a study was made of adrenocortical function by measuring blood plasma cortisol concentration and amount of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes as well as thyroid function by measuring blood plasma triidothyronine and thyroxine concentration in 58 bronchial asthma children aged 1 to 14 years .
16,18 G#protein|19,20 G#cell_type

the authors revealed alterations in the functional activity of the indicated endocrine glands depending on the intensity of bronchial patency disorders and the nature of the therapeutic measures carried out .


tar independent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus in phorbol ester stimulated t lymphocytes .
0,1 G#DNA|12,14 G#cell_type

multiple regulatory elements in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat ( hiv ltr ) are required for activation of hiv gene expression .
0,3 G#DNA|8,11 G#DNA|5,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA

previous transfection studies of hiv ltr constructs linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that multiple regulatory regions including the enhancer , sp1 , tata and tar regions were important for hiv gene expression .
4,6 G#DNA|4,7 G#DNA|10,13 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|20,21 G#DNA|22,23 G#DNA|24,25 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA

to characterize these regulatory elements further , mutations in these regions were inserted into both the 5' and 3' hiv ltrs and infectious proviral constructs were assembled .
3,5 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA

these constructs were transfected into either hela cells , jurkat cells or u937 cells in both the presence and absence of phorbol esters which have previously been demonstrated to activate hiv gene expression .
6,8 G#cell_line|9,11 G#cell_line|12,14 G#cell_line

viral gene expression was assayed by the level of p24 gag protein released from cultures transfected with the proviral constructs .
9,12 G#protein

results in all cell lines indicated that mutations of the sp1 , tata and the tar loop and stem secondary structure resulted in marked decreases in gene expression while mutations of the enhancer motif or tar primary sequence resulted in only slight decreases .
10,11 G#DNA|12,13 G#DNA|15,17 G#DNA|18,21 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA|35,38 G#DNA

however , viruses containing mutations in either the tar loop sequences or stem secondary structure which were very defective for gene expression in untreated jurkat cells , gave nearly wild-type levels of gene expression in phorbol ester -treated jurkat cells but not in phorbol ester -treated hela or u937 cells .

high level gene expression of these tar mutant constructs in phorbol ester -treated jurkat cells was eliminated by second site mutations in the enhancer region or by disruption of the tat gene .

a case of hypersensitivity to thyroid hormones with normally functioning thyroid gland and increased nuclear triiodothyronine receptors .
15,17 G#protein

a 52-year-old male presented himself with tachycardia crises which appeared first during childhood , increased in frequency without goiter or exophthalmos .


cardiac and adrenergic diseases were excluded .


the thyroid function was normal regarding t4 , free t4 and t3 , tbg , radioiodine uptake , tsh and t3 suppressibility ; however the tsh response to trh was decreased .


the lymphocyte nuclear t3 receptor was found with an affinity close to that of normal volunteers ( ka : 1.42 x 10(10) m-1 vs 1.95 +/- 0.35 x 10(10) m-1 ) and a binding capacity markedly increased ( 9.9 vs 3.7 +/- 0.4 fmol t3 / 100 micrograms dna ) .

pindolol was inefficient on the dysrhythmia which disappeared with carbimazole and relapsed after withdrawal of the antithyroid drug .


under carbimazole , the plasma t4 markedly decreased ( 27.7 +/- 3.6 nmol/l ) but the patient remained euthyroid .


the clinical course and the laboratory data suggest that the tachycardia crises are the consequence of a hypersensitivity of the heart to thyroid hormones , associated with an increased number of t3 nuclear receptor sites in lymphocytes .

induction of immediate early response genes by macrophage colony-stimulating factor in normal human monocytes .
2,6 G#DNA|7,10 G#protein|11,14 G#cell_type

a group of coordinately induced protooncogenes , cytoskeletal , and extracellular matrix genes have been termed immediate early response genes , and their induction has been associated with growth factor -stimulated cell proliferation .
5,6 G#DNA|7,13 G#DNA|16,20 G#DNA|28,30 G#protein

we have investigated the induction of these genes by macrophage-csf ( m-csf ) in human monocytes that do not proliferate in response to m-csf but require the factor for optimal cell differentiation .
9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|14,16 G#cell_type|23,24 G#protein

normal human monocytes were isolated , carefully washed , and incubated for 36 to 48 h in fetal bovine serum-containing medium .
1,3 G#cell_type

at the end of this incubation the resting cells were stimulated with m-csf , and rna was isolated for analysis by northern blotting .
7,9 G#cell_type|12,13 G#protein|15,16 G#RNA

rna from control resting cells contained low to undetectable levels of c-jun , fibronectin receptor , and actin mrna .
0,1 G#RNA|3,5 G#cell_type|11,12 G#RNA|13,15 G#RNA|17,19 G#RNA

within 15 to 30 min of addition of m-csf , however , there was a dramatic coordinate induction of these genes .
8,9 G#protein

the c-jun gene expression was very transient and was not detectable by 60 min after m-csf addition .
1,3 G#DNA|15,16 G#protein

in contrast , the expression of actin and fibronectin receptor mrna was more sustained , and the expression of these genes remained elevated at 24 to 48 h after m-csf addition .
6,11 G#RNA|29,30 G#protein

we also observed the induction of the myelomonocytic specific tyrosine kinase hck gene simultaneously with the other immediate early response genes .
7,11 G#protein|7,13 G#DNA|17,21 G#DNA

the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block the induction of any of these genes , and in fact , super-induced the expression of c-jun and hck .

therefore , in normal human monocytes m-csf induces immediate early response genes without inducing cell proliferation .

these genes may then play a role in altering the physiologic status of the cells in response to csf .

inducible nuclear factor binding to the kappa b elements of the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer in t cells can be blocked by cyclosporin a in a signal-dependent manner .
1,3 G#protein|6,9 G#DNA|11,15 G#DNA|16,18 G#cell_type

cyclosporin a ( csa ) is thought to exert its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the expression of a distinct set of lymphokine genes which are induced upon t-cell activation , among them the gene coding for interleukin-2 .
21,23 G#DNA|36,37 G#protein

in addition , the activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) is partially suppressed .


to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying suppression by csa , we have investigated the effects of this drug on transcription factors in t cells .
20,22 G#protein|23,25 G#cell_type

here we report that the formation of two distinct mitogen-inducible dna-binding complexes , the kappa b complex within the hiv enhancer and the nfat-1 complex within the interleukin-2 enhancer , is inhibited in the presence of csa .
9,12 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|19,21 G#DNA|23,25 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|27,29 G#DNA

the kappa b-binding activity with the hiv enhancer is inhibited only if it is activated via the mitogen phytohemagglutinin whereas phorbol myristate acetate -mediated activation is completely insensitive to the drug .
6,8 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

this suggests a model in which functionally indistinguishable kappa b complexes can be activated via two separate pathways of signal transduction distinguishable by csa .

purification of tcf-1 alpha , a t-cell-specific transcription factor that activates the t-cell receptor c alpha gene enhancer in a context-dependent manner .
2,4 G#protein|6,9 G#protein|12,18 G#DNA

the differentiation of t cells into functionally diverse subpopulations is controlled in part , by transcriptional activation and silencing ; however , little is known in detail about the proteins that influence this developmental process .
3,5 G#cell_type

we have purified a new t-cell-specific factor , tcf-1 alpha , that is implicated in the activation of genes encoding a major component of the human t-cell receptor ( tcr ) .
5,7 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|25,28 G#protein|29,30 G#protein

tcf-1 alpha , originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the hiv-1 promoter , was found to bind to the tcr alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of t-cell development than the tcr alpha gene ( e.g. , p56lck and cd3 delta ) .
0,2 G#protein|13,15 G#DNA|22,23 G#protein|22,25 G#DNA|27,28 G#DNA|30,31 G#DNA|41,42 G#protein|41,44 G#DNA|47,48 G#DNA|49,51 G#DNA

sequences related to the tcf-1 alpha binding motif ( 5'-ggcaccctttga-3' ) are also found in the human tcr delta ( and possibly tcr beta ) enhancers .
4,6 G#protein|4,8 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|17,19 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|22,23 G#protein|22,24 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA|25,26 G#DNA

southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that tcf-1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57- to 53-kd proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature t-cell lines ( jurkat , ccrf-cem ) and not in mature b cells ( jy , namalwa ) or nonlymphoid ( hela ) cell lines .
14,16 G#protein|23,27 G#protein|32,37 G#cell_line|38,39 G#cell_line|40,41 G#cell_line|45,48 G#cell_line|49,50 G#cell_line|51,52 G#cell_line|54,60 G#cell_line

a small 95-bp fragment of the tcr alpha control region that contains the tcf-1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a camp-response element ( the cre or t alpha 1 motif ) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid-specific protein ( tcf-2 alpha ) behaved as a potent t-cell-specific enhancer in vivo .
6,7 G#protein|6,10 G#DNA|13,15 G#protein|13,17 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA|24,25 G#DNA|26,30 G#DNA|33,35 G#DNA|38,40 G#protein|41,43 G#protein|48,50 G#DNA

tandem copies of this enhancer functioned synergistically in mature ( jurkat ) t-cell lines as well as resting and activated immature ( ccrf-cem ) t-cell lines .
8,14 G#cell_line|20,26 G#cell_line

mutation of the tcf-1 alpha binding site diminished enhancer activity and disrupted the synergism observed in vivo between tandem enhancer repeats .
3,5 G#protein|3,7 G#DNA|18,21 G#DNA

the tcf-1 alpha binding site was also required for tcr alpha enhancer activity in transcriptionally active extracts from jurkat but not hela cells , confirming that tcf-1 alpha is a t-cell-specific transcription factor .
1,3 G#protein|1,5 G#DNA|9,10 G#protein|18,19 G#cell_line|21,23 G#cell_line|26,28 G#protein|30,33 G#protein

curiously , the tcf-1 alpha binding element was inactive in vivo when removed from its neighboring elements on the tcr alpha enhancer and positioned in one or more copies upstream of a heterologous promoter .

thus , the transcriptional activity of tcf-1 alpha appears to depend on the tcf-2 alpha and t alpha 1 ( creb ) transcription factors and the context of its binding site within the tcr alpha enhancer .

tandem ap-1-binding sites within the human beta-globin dominant control region function as an inducible enhancer in erythroid cells .
0,3 G#DNA|5,10 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA|16,18 G#cell_type

a powerful enhancer has been mapped to an 18-bp dna segment located 11 kb 5' to the human epsilon-globin gene within the dominant control or locus-activating region .
8,11 G#DNA|17,20 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA|25,27 G#DNA

this enhancer is inducible in k562 human erythroleukemia cells , increasing linked gamma-globin promoter /luciferase gene expression to 170-fold over an enhancerless construct .
1,2 G#DNA|5,9 G#cell_line|12,14 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

the enhancer consists of tandem ap-1-binding sites , phased 10 bp apart , which are both required for full activity .
1,2 G#DNA|4,7 G#DNA

dna-protein binding assays with nuclear extracts from induced cells demonstrate a high molecular weight complex on the enhancer .
11,15 G#protein|17,18 G#DNA

the formation of this complex also requires both ap-1 sites and correlates with maximal enhancer activity .
8,10 G#DNA|14,15 G#DNA

induction of the enhancer may have a role in the increase in globin gene transcription that characterizes erythroid maturation .
3,4 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA

enhancer activity appears to be mediated by the binding of a complex of proteins from the jun and fos families to tandem ap-1 consensus sequences .

identification of a novel factor that interacts with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter and stimulates transcription in conjunction with the lymphoid cell-specific factor otf2 .
3,5 G#protein|9,12 G#DNA|19,22 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

the tissue-specific expression of the mopc 141 immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was studied by using in vitro transcription .
5,10 G#DNA

b-cell-specific transcription of this gene was dependent on the octamer element 5'-atgcaaag-3' , located in the upstream region of this promoter and in the promoters of all other immunoglobulin heavy- and light- chain genes .
9,11 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|20,21 G#DNA|24,25 G#DNA|28,34 G#DNA

the interaction of purified octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 ( otf1 and otf2 ) with the mopc 141 promoter was studied by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and dnase i footprinting .
5,7 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|17,20 G#DNA|29,31 G#protein

purified otf1 from hela cells and otf1 and otf2 from b cells bound to identical sequences within the heavy-chain promoter .
1,2 G#protein|3,5 G#cell_line|6,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|18,20 G#DNA

the otf interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5'-ctcagga-3' , and it seems likely that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter .
8,10 G#DNA|21,23 G#protein|26,30 G#DNA|32,33 G#DNA

in addition to these elements , we identified a second regulatory element , the n element with the sequence 5'-ggaacctccccc-3' .
10,12 G#DNA|14,16 G#DNA

the n element could independently mediate low levels of transcription in both b-cell and hela-cell extracts , and , in conjunction with the octamer element , it can promote high levels of transcription in b-cell extracts .
1,3 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA

the n element bound a transcription factor , ntf , that is ubiquitous in cell-type distribution , and ntf was distinct from any of the previously described proteins that bind to similar sequences .
1,3 G#DNA|5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|25,28 G#protein

based on these results , we propose that ntf and otf2 interactions ( both with their cognate dna elements and possibly at the protein-protein level ) may be critical to b-cell-specific expression and that these interactions provide additional pathways for regulating gene expression .

nf-kappa b as inducible transcriptional activator of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene .
0,2 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|8,12 G#DNA

the expression of the gene encoding the granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) is induced upon activation of t cells with phytohemagglutinin and active phorbolester and upon expression of tax1 , a transactivating protein of the human t-cell leukemia virus type i .
8,11 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|19,21 G#cell_type|22,23 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|33,35 G#protein

the same agents induce transcription from the interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain and interleukin-2 genes , depending on promoter elements that bind the inducible transcription factor nf-kappa b ( or an nf-kappa b -like factor ) .
7,13 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|21,24 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|29,31 G#protein|29,33 G#protein

we therefore tested the possibility that the gm-csf gene is also regulated by a cognate motif for the nf-kappa b transcription factor .
7,8 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA|18,20 G#protein|18,22 G#protein

a recent functional analysis by miyatake et al. ( s. miyatake , m. seiki , m. yoshida , and k. arai , mol. cell. biol. 8 : 5581-5587 , 1988 ) described a short promoter region in the gm-csf gene that conferred strong inducibility by t-cell-activating signals and tax1 , but no nf-kappa b -binding motifs were identified .
33,36 G#DNA|38,39 G#protein|38,40 G#DNA|48,49 G#protein|52,54 G#protein|52,56 G#DNA

using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we showed binding of purified human nf-kappa b and of the nf-kappa b activated in jurkat t cells to an oligonucleotide comprising the gm-csf promoter element responsible for mediating responsiveness to t-cell-activating signals and tax1 .
12,14 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|22,24 G#cell_type|21,24 G#cell_line|29,30 G#protein|29,32 G#DNA|40,41 G#protein

as shown by a methylation interference analysis and oligonucleotide competition experiments , purified nf-kappa b binds at positions -82 to -91 ( gggaactacc ) of the gm-csf promoter sequence with an affinity similar to that with which it binds to the biologically functional kappa b motif in the beta interferon promoter ( gggaaattcc ) .
13,15 G#protein|17,21 G#DNA|26,27 G#protein|26,28 G#DNA|41,46 G#DNA|48,51 G#DNA

two kappa b-like motifs at positions -98 to -108 of the gm-csf promoter were also recognized but with much lower affinities .
1,4 G#DNA|5,9 G#DNA|11,12 G#protein|11,13 G#DNA

our data provide strong evidence that the expression of the gm-csf gene following t-cell activation is controlled by binding of the nf-kappa b transcription factor to a high-affinity binding site in the gm-csf promoter .

effects of mitogenic agents upon glucocorticoid action in human tonsillar t- lymphocytes .
11,12 G#cell_type|8,12 G#cell_type

the treatment of human tonsillar t- lymphocytes with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( pma ) , resulted in about two fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) number , without any significant change in the receptor affinity .
6,7 G#cell_type|3,7 G#cell_type|22,24 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

this increase disappeared in the presence of cycloheximide .


alone , pma and calcium ionophore a23187 did not affect , but together stimulated , like phytohaemagglutinin ( pha ) , leucine and , in particular , thymidine incorporation .
16,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

pma enhanced slightly the stimulatory effect of pha .
7,8 G#protein

alone , these agents failed to alter the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on thymidine and leucine incorporation ; however , pma -a23187 and pma -pha combinations appeared to antagonize the suppression by dexamethasone .

to be or not to be a responder in t-cell responses : ubiquitous oligopeptides in all proteins .


amino acid sequences of all proteins are essays written in the same language .


accordingly , the same set of words and phrases ( oligopeptides ) appear in totally unrelated proteins .
15,17 G#protein

the reason that only certain individuals of particular major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) haplotypes can mount t-cell responses against a given antigen of pathogens is found in the fact that t-cell receptors are designed to recognize 18-20 residue-long peptide fragments sandwiched between two alpha-helices of class i or class ii mhc molecules .
8,15 G#protein|31,33 G#protein|44,45 G#protein|46,48 G#protein|49,53 G#protein

at this range of peptide lengths , most would appear as self , while nonselfness of the remainders are destined to be quite ambiguous , hence creating responders and nonresponders .


two distinct signal transmission pathways in t lymphocytes are inhibited by complexes formed between an immunophilin and either fk506 or rapamycin .
6,8 G#cell_type|15,16 G#protein

proliferation and immunologic function of t lymphocytes are initiated by signals from the antigen receptor that are inhibited by the immunosuppressant fk506 but not by its structural analog , rapamycin .
5,7 G#cell_type|13,15 G#protein

on the other hand , interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) -induced signals are blocked by rapamycin but not by fk506 .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

remarkably , these two drugs inhibit each other 's actions , raising the possibility that both act by means of a common immunophilin ( immunosuppressant binding protein ) .
22,23 G#protein|24,27 G#protein

we find that the dissociation constant of rapamycin to the fk506 binding protein fkbp ( kd = 0.2 nm ) is close to the dissociation constant of fk506 to fkbp ( kd = 0.4 nm ) and to their effective biologic inhibitory concentrations .
10,13 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|29,30 G#protein

however , an excess of rapamycin is needed to revert fk506 -mediated inhibition of il-2 production , apoptosis , and transcriptional activation of nf-at , a t-cell-specific transcription factor necessary for il-2 gene activation .
14,15 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|26,29 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|31,33 G#DNA

similarly , an excess of fk506 is needed to revert rapamycin -mediated inhibition of il-2 -induced proliferation .
14,15 G#protein

the drug concentrations required for antagonism may be explained by the relative affinity of the drugs to , and by the abundance of , the immunophilin fkbp .
25,26 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

fkbp has been shown to catalyze the interconversion of the cis- and trans- rotamers of the peptidyl-prolyl amide bond of peptide substrates ; here we show that rapamycin , like fk506 , is a potent inhibitor of the rotamase activity of fkbp ( ki = 0.2 nm ) .
0,1 G#protein|16,19 G#protein|41,42 G#protein

neither fkbp binding nor inhibition of rotamase activity of fkbp alone is sufficient to explain the biologic actions of these drugs .
1,2 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

rather , these findings suggest that immunophilin bound to fk506 interferes with antigen receptor -induced signals , while rapamycin bound to the immunophilin interferes with il-2 -induced signals .

adherence-dependent increase in human monocyte pdgf(b) mrna is associated with increases in c-fos , c-jun , and egr2 mrna .
3,7 G#RNA|12,19 G#RNA

adherence is an important initial step in the transition of a circulating monocyte to a tissue macrophage .
11,13 G#cell_type|15,17 G#cell_type

this differentiation is accompanied by an augmented capacity to generate growth factors .
10,12 G#protein

we hypothesized that adherence itself might be an important trigger for a sequence of gene activation culminating in cells with increased mrna encoding profibrotic growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor b subunit ( pdgf[b] ) and transforming growth factor-beta ( tgf-beta ) .
21,22 G#RNA|24,26 G#protein|28,33 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|37,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein

after in vitro adherence , human monocytes had a biphasic increase in pdgf(b) mrna with peaks at 6 h and 13 d .
12,13 G#protein|12,14 G#RNA

no increase in tgf-beta mrna was observed .
3,4 G#protein|3,5 G#RNA

the 6-h increase in pdgf(b) mrna was adherence dependent , and in addition , was abrogated when the cytoskeletal integrity was compromised by cytochalasin d .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#RNA

the 6-h increase in pdgf(b) mrna was unaltered by adherence in the presence of the monocyte stimulus lipopolysaccharide .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#RNA

adherence to either fibronectin or collagen-coated plastic had little consistent effect on pdgf(b) mrna accumulation .
12,13 G#protein|12,14 G#RNA

the increased pdgf(b) mrna observed in adherent monocytes was accompanied by increases in mrnas of the early growth response genes c-fos ( maximal at 20 min ) , c-jun , and egr2 ( maximal at 6-24 h ) .
2,3 G#protein|2,4 G#RNA|6,8 G#cell_type|13,14 G#RNA|16,20 G#DNA|20,21 G#DNA

the increase in c-jun and egr2 , but not c-fos , mrna was also abrogated by cytochalasin d .
9,10 G#DNA

these observations suggest that adherence results in increases of c-fos , c-jun , egr2 , and pdgf(b) mrna .
9,18 G#RNA

in addition , the increases in c-jun , egr2 , and pdgf(b) may depend on cytoskeletal rearrangement .
6,7 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|11,12 G#protein

modulation of these events at the time of adherence offers a mechanism by which differential priming of the cells may be accomplished .


single cell assay of a transcription factor reveals a threshold in transcription activated by signals emanating from the t-cell antigen receptor .
5,7 G#protein|18,21 G#protein

stimulation of t lymphocytes through their antigen receptor leads to the appearance of several transcription factors , including nf-at and nf-kappa b , which are involved in regulating genes required for immunologic activation .
2,4 G#cell_type|6,8 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,22 G#protein

to investigate the activity of a single transcription factor in individual viable cells , we have applied an assay that uses the fluorescence-activated cell sorter to quantitate beta-galactosidase ( beta-gal ) .
7,9 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_type|27,28 G#protein|29,30 G#protein

we have analyzed the distribution of nf-at transcriptional activity among t cells undergoing activation by using a construct in which three tandem copies of the nf-at -binding site directs transcription of the lacz gene .
6,7 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|25,26 G#protein|25,28 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA

unexpectedly , stimulation of cloned stably transfected jurkat t cells leads to a bimodal pattern of beta-gal expression in which some cells express no beta-gal and others express high levels .
8,10 G#cell_type|4,10 G#cell_line|24,25 G#protein

this expression pattern can not be accounted for by cell-cycle position or heritable variation .


further results , in which beta-gal activity is correlated with nf-at -binding activity , indicate that the concentration of nf-at must exceed a critical threshold before transcription initiates .
5,6 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|19,20 G#protein

this threshold likely reflects the nf-at concentration-dependent assembly of transcription complexes at the promoter .
5,6 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|13,14 G#DNA

similar constructs controlled by nf-kappa b or the entire interleukin-2 enhancer show bimodal expression patterns during induction , suggesting that thresholds set by the concentration of transcription factors may be a common property of inducible genes .

the epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) bmrf1 promoter for early antigen ( ea-d ) is regulated by the ebv transactivators , brlf1 and bzlf1 , in a cell-specific manner .
1,8 G#DNA|9,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

the epstein-barr virus early antigen diffuse component ( ea-d ) is essential for epstein-barr virus dna polymerase activity , and its activity is suppressed during latent infection .
3,5 G#protein|1,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA

we investigated the regulation of the promoter ( bmrf1 ) for this early gene by studying its responsiveness in vitro to two immediate-early viral transactivators , bzlf1 ( z ) and brlf1 ( r ) , focusing on the differences in response in lymphoid cells and epithelial cells .
6,7 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|22,25 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|33,34 G#protein|43,45 G#cell_type|46,48 G#cell_type

in lymphoid cells , z or r alone produced only small increases in ea-d promoter activity , whereas both transactivators together produced a large stimulatory effect .
1,3 G#cell_type|4,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|13,15 G#DNA|19,20 G#protein

in epithelial cells , the z transactivator alone produced maximal stimulation of the ea-d promoter ; the effect of r and z together was no greater than that of z alone .
1,3 G#cell_type|5,7 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|13,15 G#DNA|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|29,30 G#protein

deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of the ea-d promoter demonstrated that in epithelial cells the potential ap-1 binding site plays an essential role in z responsiveness , although sequences further upstream are also important .
7,8 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA|12,14 G#cell_type|16,19 G#DNA|24,25 G#protein

in lymphoid cells , only the upstream sequences are required for transactivation by the z/r combination , and the ap-1 site is dispensable .
1,3 G#cell_type|6,8 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

these data suggest that ea-d ( bmrf1 ) promoter regulation by z and r is cell type specific and appears to involve different mechanisms in each cell type .

complementary dna encoding the human t-cell fk506 -binding protein , a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase distinct from cyclophilin .
0,2 G#DNA|4,9 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|16,17 G#protein

the recently discovered macrolide fk506 has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations 100-fold lower than cyclosporin a , a cyclic undecapeptide that is used to prevent rejection after transplantation of bone marrow and organs , such as kidney , heart , and liver .


after the recent discovery that the cyclosporin a -binding protein cyclophilin is identical to peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase , a cellular binding protein for fk506 was found to be distinct from cyclophilin but to have the same enzymatic activity .
6,10 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|19,22 G#protein|30,31 G#protein

in this study , we isolated a cdna coding for fk506 -binding protein ( fkbp ) from human peripheral blood t cells by using mixed 20-mer oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the sequence , glu-asp-gly-lys-lys-phe-asp , reported for bovine fkbp .
7,8 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type|41,42 G#protein|40,42 G#protein

the dna isolated contained an open reading frame encoding 108 amino acid residues .


the first 40 residues of the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to those of the reported amino-terminal sequence of bovine fkbp , indicating that the dna sequence isolated represents the gene coding for fkbp .
7,10 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|34,35 G#protein

computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that fkbp exhibits no internal homology and does not have significant sequence similarity to any other amino acid sequences of known proteins , including cyclophilin .
10,11 G#protein|33,34 G#protein

this result suggests that two catalytically similar proteins , cyclophilin and fkbp , evolved independently .
9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein

in northern blot analysis , mrna species of approximately 1.8 kilobases that hybridized with human fkbp cdna were detected in poly(a)+ rnas from brain , lung , liver , and placental cells and leukocytes .
5,7 G#RNA|15,16 G#protein|14,17 G#DNA|20,22 G#RNA|30,32 G#cell_type|33,34 G#cell_type

induction of jurkat leukemic t cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin did not affect the level of fkbp mrna .
4,6 G#cell_type|2,6 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|18,20 G#RNA

southern blot analysis of human genomic dna digested with different restriction enzymes suggests the existence of only a few copies of the dna sequence encoding fkbp .
4,7 G#DNA|10,12 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

this is in contrast to the result that as many as 20 copies of the cyclophilin gene and possible pseudogenes may be present in the mammalian genome .

involvement of a second lymphoid-specific enhancer element in the regulation of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene expression .
4,7 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA

to determine whether enhancer elements in addition to the highly conserved octamer ( octa ) -nucleotide motif are important for lymphoid-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain ( igh ) gene , we have investigated the effect of mutating the binding site for a putative additional lymphoid-specific transcription factor , designated nf-microb , in the murine igh enhancer .
3,5 G#DNA|11,17 G#DNA|24,30 G#DNA|39,41 G#DNA|43,48 G#protein|50,51 G#protein|54,57 G#DNA

we demonstrate that the nf-microb-binding site plays a critical role in the igh enhancer , because mutation of the microb dna motif decreased transcriptional activity of the igh enhancer in cells of the b-cell lineage but not in nonlymphoid cells .
4,6 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|27,29 G#DNA|33,35 G#cell_type|38,40 G#cell_type

this effect was comparable to or even stronger than the effect of a mutation in the octa site .
16,18 G#DNA

moreover , combined mutation of both microb and octa sites further reduced enhancer activity in lymphoid cells .
6,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|15,17 G#cell_type

interestingly , alteration of either the microb or e3 site in a 70-base-pair fragment of the igh enhancer that lacks the binding site for octa abolished enhancer activity in lymphoid cells completely .
6,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|29,31 G#cell_type

nevertheless , a multimer of the microb motif alone showed no enhancer activity .
6,7 G#DNA|6,8 G#DNA

dnase footprinting analysis corroborated the functional data showing that a lymphoid-specific protein binds to the microb dna motif .
10,12 G#protein|15,16 G#DNA|15,18 G#DNA

our results suggest that the microb element is a new crucial element important for lymphoid-specific expression of the igh gene but that interaction with another enhancer element is essential for its activity .

stimulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( hiv-2 ) gene expression by the cytomegalovirus and hiv-2 transactivator gene .
17,20 G#DNA

human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) often causes latent infection .


transactivation by some dna viruses has been implicated in inducing hiv-1 replication and pathogenesis .


the transactivator ( ie-2 ) gene of the human cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) can enhance hiv-2 as well as hiv-1 gene expression in vitro .
1,6 G#DNA

this inducer can act in concert with the hiv-2 tat gene and t-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human cd4+ lymphocytes .
8,11 G#DNA|19,22 G#cell_type

while the hiv-2 and hiv-1 tat genes and t-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action , the cmv transactivator in combination with the hiv-2 tat or t-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components .
4,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#protein|18,20 G#DNA|24,26 G#DNA|27,29 G#protein

both hiv-2 and cmv transactivators enhance hiv-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation , with cmv transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation .
4,5 G#protein|3,5 G#DNA|22,23 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

a significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators .
4,5 G#RNA|13,14 G#protein

deletion mutation analysis of the hiv-2 long terminal repeat ( ltr ) suggests that the element that responds to cmv transactivation in human cd4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the hiv-2 enhancer element .

quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of mononuclear infiltrates in breast carcinomas -- correlation with tumour differentiation .
4,6 G#cell_type

inflammatory infiltrates were analysed in tissue sections of 76 breast carcinomas by counting the percentage of macrophages , iga+ and igg+ plasma cells , t cells with their subpopulations , and natural killer cells , and by measuring postcapillary venules ( pcvs , found in 12 cases ) within the infiltrates .
0,2 G#cell_type|16,17 G#cell_type|18,23 G#cell_type|24,26 G#cell_type|31,34 G#cell_type

these parameters were correlated with nuclear grade and biochemically determined hormone receptor status , known markers of tumour differentiation .


a direct correlation was found between the extent of inflammation and nuclear grade ( p less than 0.0001 ) , and an inverse correlation between inflammation and oestrogen receptor ( or ) positivity ( p less than 0.05 ) as well as inflammation and progesterone receptor ( pr ) positivity ( p less than 0.05 ) .
27,29 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|44,46 G#protein|47,48 G#protein

the percentage of the okt8+ suppressor/cytotoxic t cells increased when the inflammation expanded from scanty to moderate ( p less than 0.02 ) .

the diameter of the pcvs also increased with increasing inflammatory infiltrate ( p less than 0.02 ) .


in addition , a direct correlation exists between the diameter of the pcvs and both the percentage of the okt8+ t cells ( p less than 0.04 ) and the leu-7+ natural killer cells ( p less than 0.03 ) .

using an avidin -biotin peroxidase detection system , we found a nuclear staining in 14.6 +/- 3.7 % ( mean +/- sem , n = 27 ) of pregnancy lymphocytes , while only 0.47 +/- 0.33 % ( mean +/- sem , n = 15 ) of nonpregnancy lymphocytes reacted with the antibody .
2,3 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|29,30 G#cell_line|28,30 G#cell_type|48,49 G#cell_line|47,49 G#cell_type

to characterize the receptor-bearing subset , cd8+ and cd4+ cells were depleted by complement-dependent lysis .
6,10 G#cell_line

depletion of cd8+ cells was accompanied by 62 +/- 18 % loss of progesterone receptor -bearing cells , while depletion of cd4+ cells resulted in a twofold increase in the number of positively staining lymphocytes .
2,4 G#cell_line|13,15 G#protein|13,17 G#cell_line|21,23 G#cell_line|34,35 G#cell_line

in nonpregnancy lymphocytes a 3-day pha treatment , as well as allogeneic stimulation , resulted in a significant increase in the number of receptor-containing cells .
2,3 G#cell_line|1,3 G#cell_line|5,6 G#protein|23,25 G#cell_type

these results suggest that pregnancy , but not nonpregnancy , lymphocytes contain progesterone binding structures , and that these are inducible by mitogenic or alloantigenic stimuli .

activation of human cd4 t lymphocytes .
2,6 G#cell_line

interaction of fibronectin with vla-5 receptor on cd4 cells induces the ap-1 transcription factor .
2,3 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|7,9 G#cell_line|11,14 G#protein

fibronectin synergized with anti-cd3 antibody to promote cd4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when cd4 cells were cultured with anti-cd3 alone or fibronectin alone .
0,1 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|21,23 G#cell_line|26,27 G#protein|29,30 G#protein

in addition , anti-cd29 ( integrin beta 1 ) as well as anti-vla-5 ( human fibronectin receptor ) antibodies blocked this cd4 cell activation in this system .
3,4 G#protein|5,8 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|21,23 G#cell_line

although anti-cd3 alone or fibronectin alone can not induce il-2 message by cd4 cells , the combination of anti-cd3 plus fibronectin induced il-2 message by cd4 cells .
1,2 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|25,27 G#cell_line

in an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which il-2 message was generated , we showed that a fibronectin -vla-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the cd3 pathway of activation by the induction of an ap-1 transcriptional factor .
9,10 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|40,43 G#protein

thus the vla-5 fibronectin receptor on cd4 cells can play a complementary role in cd3 - tcr -mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin .

glucocorticoid receptors on mononuclear leukocytes in alzheimer 's disease .
0,2 G#protein|3,5 G#cell_type

several lines of evidence suggest disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) system in alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .


in an exploration of the potential role of the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) in ad , gr density and affinity were assessed on mononuclear leukocytes of 12 ad patients and 12 healthy controls .
24,26 G#cell_type

gr binding characteristics did not differ between patients and controls or between patients subdivided according to diagnosis or associated clinical features .


these data suggest that the abnormalities of the hpa system in ad are not related to a gr deficiency .

oncogene amplification correlates with dense lymphocyte infiltration in human breast cancers : a role for hematopoietic growth factor release by tumor cells ?
15,18 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

one hundred six primary breast cancer samples were analysed for c-erbb2 , int-2 , and c-myc gene amplification .


surgically confirmed nodal involvement was observed in 42 % .


level of gene amplification was studied by southern and/or slot blot techniques .


amplified c-erbb2 gene sequences were present in 21.5 % of all samples .
1,4 G#DNA

int-2 was amplified in 13.1 % and c-myc was amplified in 10.3 % .
0,1 G#DNA|7,8 G#DNA

in a non-parametric test ( kruskal-wallis ) a strong negative association was found between high levels of c-erbb2 amplification and absence of estrogen receptor ( er ) ( p = .0009 ) or progesterone receptor ( pr ) ( p = .011 ) expression .
17,18 G#DNA|33,35 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

no correlations were found between all or high levels of amplification of each oncogene separately or combined with t , n , grade , multifocality of tumor , or associated carcinoma in situ .


there was a trend approaching statistical significance for patients with c-erbb2 amplifications to have positive lymph nodes at surgery ( p = 0.09 ) .
10,11 G#DNA

a somewhat surprising finding however was a very strong association between oncogene amplification and dense lymphocyte infiltration of the tumor ( p = .05 ) . this correlation is even stronger when only high levels of amplification are considered , either for each oncogene separately ( p = .0048 ) or in combination ( p = .0007 ) .
11,12 G#DNA

we propose that malignant cell cytokine production may help explain this observation .

suppression of signals required for activation of transcription factor nf-kappa b in cells constitutively expressing the htlv-i tax protein .
9,11 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|16,19 G#protein

transient short-term expression of the tax protein of human t-cell leukemia virus type-i ( htlv-i ) leads to activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor nf-kappa b .
5,7 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|22,26 G#protein

consistent with findings obtained with transient expression assays , we observed marked accumulation of the transcription factor nf-kappa b in the nucleus of namalwa b lymphoid cells , which constitutively express tax .
17,19 G#protein|15,19 G#protein|23,27 G#cell_line|31,32 G#protein

in contrast , nf-kappa b activity was not detected in the nucleus following long-term expression of tax in jurkat t lymphocytes .
3,5 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|18,21 G#cell_line

the ability of both mitogens and cytokines to activate nf-kappa b was also blocked in jurkat cells constitutively expressing tax .
6,7 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|15,17 G#cell_line|19,20 G#protein

however , the activation of other mitogen-inducible transcription factors , such as fos and jun , was unaffected .
6,9 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

thus , depending on the cellular environment , the short- and long-term effects of tax expression can be quite different .
14,15 G#protein

consequently , one function of tax in cells infected with htlv-i might involve cell-type-specific suppression , as opposed to activation , of distinct signal pathways .
5,6 G#protein

the cells lines described here should be useful for the delineation of signaling pathways utilized in the selective regulation of gene expression .


interferon-gamma and the sexual dimorphism of autoimmunity .
0,1 G#protein

the sexual difference in the incidence of autoimmune diseases has remained an enigma for many years .


in the examination of the induction of autoimmunity in transgenic mice , evidence has been obtained further implicating the lymphokine interferon-gamma in the etiology of autoimmunity .
19,20 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

sex steroid regulation of the production of this molecule , as well as other cytokines , may help explain the gender-specific differences in the immune system , including autoimmunity .

cloning of a transcriptionally active human tata binding factor .

transcription factor iid ( tfiid ) binds to the tata box promoter element and regulates the expression of most eukaryotic genes transcribed by rna polymerase ii .
0,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|9,13 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA|23,26 G#protein

complementary dna ( cdna ) encoding a human tfiid protein has been cloned .
0,2 G#DNA|3,4 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|7,10 G#protein

the human tfiid polypeptide has 339 amino acids and a molecular size of 37,745 daltons .
2,3 G#protein|1,4 G#protein

the carboxyl-terminal 181 amino acids of the human tfiid protein shares 80 % identity with the tfiid protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae .
1,5 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|16,17 G#protein

the amino terminus contains an unusual repeat of 38 consecutive glutamine residues and an x-thr-pro repeat .

a novel t-cell trans-activator that recognizes a phorbol ester-inducible element of the interleukin-2 promoter .
2,4 G#protein|7,10 G#DNA|12,13 G#protein|12,14 G#DNA

the interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) gene promoter is recognized by several cell-type-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators that integrate information transmitted by various signaling systems leading to il-2 production and t-cell activation .
1,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|1,8 G#DNA|12,17 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|30,31 G#cell_type

using a combination of transfection , protein-dna binding , and in vitro transcription methods , we have discovered the novel t-cell-specific transcriptional activator tcf-1 ( for t-cell factor-1 ) , which recognizes a t-cell-specific response element ( tce ) located within the il-2 promoter .
19,23 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|33,36 G#DNA|37,38 G#DNA|42,43 G#protein|42,44 G#DNA

although the tce is similar in sequence to a consensus nf kappa b site , several criteria indicate that tcf-1 is distinct from nf kappa b .
2,3 G#DNA|10,13 G#protein|10,14 G#DNA|9,14 G#DNA|19,20 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

however , like nf kappa b , tcf-1 activity is induced by phorbol esters and other t-cell activators .

risk factors for breast recurrence in premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with ductal cancers treated by conservation therapy .


risk factors for local failure were evaluated for 496 clinical stage i-ii patients with infiltrating ductal carcinomas ( median follow-up , 71 months ) treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy .


monofactorial analysis identified the following factors to be correlated with increased risk : moderate/marked mononuclear cell reaction ( mcr ) , high histologic grade ( g ) , extensive intraductal component ( eic ) , tumor necrosis , macroscopic multiplicity , estrogen receptor negativity , anatomic tumor size , age younger than 40 years , and vascular invasion .
41,43 G#protein

only mcr , g , and eic proved significant in cox multivariate analysis .


these risk factors were highly age dependent , with eic markedly more prevalent in women younger than 50 , mcr and g in women younger than 40 .


separate cox analysis for premenopausal patients showed that mcr /eic determined risk independent of resection margins : tumors with mcr had a 28 % , and with eic a 22 % probability of recurring locally by 5 years .


premenopausal patients with neither risk factor had a very low failure rate ( 2.6 % at 5 years ) , regardless of age .


for postmenopausal patients risk of breast recurrence was determined both by adequacy of resection margins and grade , with a high local failure rate for patients having g3 tumors with positive or indeterminate margins ( 31 % at 5 years ) .


the authors conclude that the microscopic examination is the only useful tool for assessing the risk of local failure , which is quite low for the majority of patients treated with breast conservation .


high-risk patients can be recognized morphologically .


the age dependence of morphologic risk factors appears to explain the high local failure rate seen in patients younger than 40 .


tax -independent binding of multiple cellular factors to tax -response element dna of htlv-i .
0,1 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|8,12 G#DNA

the human t-cell leukemia virus type i ( htlv-i ) promoter contains three copies of imperfect repeats of a 21-base pair sequence designated here as tre ( tax -response element ) that is responsive to the virally encoded transactivator protein tax .
1,11 G#DNA|25,26 G#DNA|27,28 G#protein|27,30 G#DNA|36,40 G#protein|40,41 G#protein

we have identified and separated four nuclear proteins from c81-66-45 cells , an htlv-i immortalized tax -expressing human t-lymphocyte line ( salahuddin et al. , 1983 ) , that interact with the tre -dna , none of which are identical with the tax -protein .
6,8 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|13,20 G#cell_line|32,33 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA|42,43 G#protein|42,44 G#protein

the proteins identified have molecular weights of about 32 , 36 to 42 , 50 and 110 kd .


four different methods were used to identify the proteins .


first , from different cell lines three or all four of the nuclear proteins were specifically cross-linked by uv irradiation to the radioactively labeled tre -dna fragment .
12,14 G#protein|24,25 G#DNA|24,27 G#DNA

second , tre -dna binding proteins sedimented through a glycerol density gradient at rates corresponding to proteins of native molecular weights of 35 to 50 kd and 110 kd .
2,3 G#DNA|2,6 G#protein

third , only the 50 kd protein was retained on a biotinylated dna-streptavidin matrix when the dna fragment contained the tre -dna .
4,7 G#protein|20,21 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA

fourth , extensive purification by several cycles of tre -dna affinity chromatography resulted in the 32 , 36 to 42 and 110 kd proteins and to less extent the 50 kd factor .
8,9 G#DNA|15,24 G#protein|29,32 G#protein

two abundant proteins of 75 and 80 kd were competed out by poly[d(i-c)] in all reactions .


the camp-response element cre , tgacgtca , present in the 21 base-pair sequence , appears to be essential for specific protein- tre -dna interactions because mutation of the two g 's destroys this complex .
1,3 G#DNA|3,4 G#DNA|10,13 G#DNA|21,22 G#DNA

this result suggests that the camp response element binding protein , creb , is involved in the protein- tre -dna complex and in mediating the tax response .

two distinct transcription factors that bind the immunoglobulin enhancer microe5/kappa 2 motif .
2,4 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA|9,12 G#DNA

activity of the immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain gene enhancers depends on a complex interplay of ubiquitous and developmentally regulated proteins .
3,11 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|19,22 G#protein|17,22 G#protein

two complementary dnas were isolated that encode proteins , denoted itf-1 and itf-2 , that are expressed in a variety of cell types and bind the microe5/kappa 2 motif found in both heavy and kappa light chain enhancers .
1,3 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|26,29 G#DNA|32,38 G#DNA

the complementary dnas are the products of distinct genes , yet both itf-1 and itf-2 are structurally and functionally similar .
1,3 G#DNA|12,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

the two proteins interact with one another through their putative helix-loop-helix motifs and each possesses a distinct domain that dictates transcription activation .

elevated glucocorticoid receptor concentrations before and after glucocorticoid therapy in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis .
1,3 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_type

the number and affinity of glucocorticoid binding sites in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis ( ad ) and healthy controls were determined under baseline conditions and after a defined oral glucocorticoid treatment .
9,12 G#cell_type

patients with ad ( n = 15 ) exhibited significantly more glucocorticoid receptors ( gr ) per cell than the control group ( n = 22 ) , while the gr affinity did not differ .
11,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|30,31 G#protein

methylprednisolone treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the gr sites per cell in the steroid-treated control group ( n = 10 ) in contrast to the patients .
9,10 G#protein

the dissociation constant was not affected by methylprednisolone treatment in either group .


in view of the therapeutic efficiency of glucocorticoids in ad and findings of abnormal camp and camp-phosphodiesterase activity , the elevated gr concentrations in ad lend support to the hypothesis of a compensatory gr upregulation due to an insufficient action of endogenous cortisol or to altered camp -induced gr expression .

the actions of cyclosporin a and fk506 suggest a novel step in the activation of t lymphocytes .
15,17 G#cell_type

cyclosporin a and fk506 are immunosuppressive compounds that have similar inhibitory effects on the expression of several lymphokines produced by t lymphocytes .
17,18 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

despite their similar effects the drugs bind to two different cytosolic protein , cyclophilin and fkbp respectively , which raises the possibility that they have different modes of action .
10,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein

using constructs in which mrna production controlled by a specific transcription factor could be readily measured we found that both cyclosporin a and fk506 completely inhibited transcription activated by nf-at , nfil2 a , nfil2 b and partially inhibited transcription activated by nf kappa b .
4,5 G#RNA|10,12 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|31,33 G#protein|34,36 G#protein|42,45 G#protein

cyclosporin a and fk506 inhibited only transcriptional activation that was dependent on ca2+ mobilization .


however , cyclosporin a and fk506 did not inhibit ca2+ mobilization dependent expression of c-fos mrna indicating that only a subset of signalling pathways regulated by ca2+ is sensitive to these drugs .
14,16 G#RNA

furthermore , we did not observe any qualitative differences between the effect of cyclosporin a and fk506 on six different transcription factors which suggests that these drugs may interfere with the activity of a novel ca2+ dependent step that regulates several transcription factors .

the internal methionine codons of human t-cell leukemia virus type ii rex gene are not required for p24rex production or virus replication and transformation .
5,13 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein

human t-cell leukemia virus types i ( htlv-i ) and ii ( htlv-ii ) have two nonstructural trans-acting regulatory genes , tax and rex , located in the 3' region of the viral genome .
16,20 G#DNA|21,22 G#DNA|23,24 G#DNA|28,30 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA

the tax gene product ( htlv-i p40tax and htlv-ii p37tax ) is the transcriptional activator of the viral long terminal repeat .
1,2 G#DNA|1,4 G#protein|6,7 G#DNA|5,7 G#protein|9,10 G#DNA|8,10 G#protein|17,21 G#DNA

the rex gene encodes two protein products , p27rex /p21rex and p26rex /p24rex in htlv-i and htlv-ii , respectively .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|11,13 G#protein

rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length gag/pol and singly spliced env mrna in the cytoplasm of htlv-infected cells .
0,1 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|12,14 G#RNA|18,20 G#cell_type

previous studies showed that the first atg of the rex gene is critical for rex production and function .
9,10 G#DNA|9,11 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein

the importance of the internal atgs to rex function is not known .
7,8 G#protein

however , in vitro mutagenesis of the htlv-i rex gene has provided indirect evidence which suggests that p21rex , and by analogy htlv-ii p24rex , results from initiation at an internal aug of the tax /rex mrna .
8,9 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|34,35 G#DNA|35,36 G#DNA|34,37 G#RNA

by using an infectious molecular clone of htlv-ii , we investigated the importance of the internal atgs of the rex gene on rex protein production and function .
19,20 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA|22,23 G#protein

our results indicate that p24rex of htlv-ii is not initiated at an internal aug and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the rex gene and , ultimately , the transforming properties of the virus .

astrocytes and glioblastoma cells express novel octamer-dna binding proteins distinct from the ubiquitous oct-1 and b cell type oct-2 proteins .

the ' octamer ' sequence , atgcaaat or its complement atttgcat , is a key element for the transcriptional regulation of immunoglobulin genes in b-lymphocytes as well as a number of housekeeping genes in all cell types .
1,5 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA|24,25 G#cell_type|31,33 G#DNA

in lymphocytes , the octamer-binding protein oct-2a and variants thereof are thought to contribute to the b-cell specific gene expression , while the ubiquitous protein oct-1 seems to control general octamer site -dependent transcription .
1,2 G#cell_type|4,6 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|16,19 G#DNA|30,32 G#DNA

various other genes , for example interleukin-1 and mhc class ii genes , contain an octamer sequence in the promoter and are expressed in cells of both the immune and nervous systems .
6,12 G#DNA|15,17 G#DNA|19,20 G#DNA

this prompted us to analyze the octamer-binding proteins in the latter cells .
6,8 G#protein

using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay , at least six novel octamer binding proteins were detected in nuclear extracts of cultured mouse astrocytes .
11,14 G#protein|20,23 G#cell_type

these proteins are differentially expressed in human glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines .
6,12 G#cell_line

the nervous system-derived ( n-oct ) proteins bound to the octamer dna sequence in a manner which is indistinguishable from the oct-1 and oct-2a proteins .
1,7 G#protein|10,13 G#DNA|21,22 G#protein|23,25 G#protein

the relationship of the n-oct proteins to oct-1 and oct-2a was analyzed by proteolytic clipping bandshift assays and by their reactivity towards antisera raised against recombinant oct-1 and oct-2a proteins .
4,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

on the basis of these assays , all n-oct-factors were found to be distinct from the ubiquitous oct-1 and the lymphoid-specific oct-2a proteins .
8,9 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|20,22 G#protein

in melanoma cells that contain the n-oct-3 factor , a transfected lymphocyte-specific promoter was neither activated nor was it repressed upon contransfection with an oct-2a expression vector .
1,3 G#cell_type|6,8 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|24,27 G#DNA

we therefore speculate that n-oct-3 and other n-oct factors have a specific role in gene expression in cells of the nervous system .

here we report the presence of a factor with the mobility and sequence-specific dna-binding characteristics of ef1 at low abundance in a wide variety of non-erythroid cell types .
16,17 G#protein|25,28 G#cell_type

this is the first report of an ef1 -like activity in non-erythroid cells and indicates that this factor may play a role in the regulation of genes expressed in such cells .

protein kinase inhibitor h-7 blocks accumulation of unspliced mrna of human t-cell leukemia virus type i ( htlv-i ) .

rex , the post-transcriptional regulator of human t-cell leukemia virus type i ( htlv-i ) , is known to induce accumulation of the unspliced viral gag-pol mrna .
0,1 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|23,27 G#RNA

rex is a phosphoprotein found in the cell nucleolus , whose function may be regulated by its localization and phosphorylation .
0,1 G#protein|3,4 G#protein

we have examined the role of phosphorylation on rex function by using a protein kinase inhibitor , h-7 [ 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine ] .
8,9 G#protein

treatment of an htlv-i infected human t-cell line with h-7 blocked specifically accumulation of the unspliced gag-pol mrna , resulting in the decreased gag protein synthesis that corresponds with the decreased in vivo phosphorylation of rex .
3,8 G#cell_line|15,18 G#RNA|23,25 G#protein|35,36 G#protein

in contrast , other viral and cellular products have not been influenced by the level of h-7 used .


therefore , the phosphorylation of rex is required for the viral rna partition of htlv-i .

cem-c7 , a human leukemic cd4+ t-lymphocyte cell line and three of its subclones , cem-4r4 , cem-3r43 , and icr-27 , previously cultured in a medium supplemented with 5 to 10 % fetal bovine serum , have been adapted to serum-free media .

the best medium of those tested was rpmi 1640 supplemented with 5 micrograms/ml each transferrin and insulin + 5 ng/ml sodium selenite +/- 0.1 % bovine serum albumin .

the expression of cd4 , a marker for t-derived lymphoid cells , was not significantly different in serum-free medium .

the increased sensitivity of cem-c7 cells and its subclones to dexamethasone in serum-free medium returned to previous levels when these cells were recultured in serum-containing medium .
4,5 G#cell_line|4,6 G#cell_line

our results suggest that substances in serum influence steroid effects on these cells and that the molecular details of glucocorticoid hormone action may be pursued more precisely in a clearly defined culture medium .


[ glucocorticoid receptors on human peripheral mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leucocytes : changes in patients with yang-deficiency ]
1,3 G#protein|4,10 G#cell_type

it was found that , in former works , the glucocorticoid receptors ( gcr ) on peripheral mixed leucocytes in patients with yang-deficiency were decreased .
10,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|16,19 G#cell_type

in this work , the mixed leucocytes were further separated into mononuclear ( mnl ) and polymorphonuclear ( pml ) leucocytes , and gcr were determined in each part of leucocytes .
5,7 G#cell_type|11,21 G#cell_type|23,24 G#protein|30,31 G#cell_type

gcr on mnl and pml in 6 yang deficient patients were 3473 +/- 413 and 4433 +/- 651 sites/cell respectively , statistically significant from the normal control group ( 4462 +/- 962 and 5622 +/- 782 sites/cell respectively , p less than 0.05 ) .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#cell_type|4,5 G#cell_type

gcr on mnl , pml and mixed leucocytes in 5 patients were determined simultaneously , and all lowered from the control group .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#cell_type|4,5 G#cell_type|6,8 G#cell_type

the results were 3369 +/- 370 , 4986 +/- 419 and 4524 +/- 852 sites/cell respectively , with the lowest gcr on mnl and highest on pml .

the ubiquitous octamer-binding protein ( s ) is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes .
1,4 G#protein|12,14 G#DNA

all immunoglobulin genes contain a conserved octanucleotide promoter element , atgcaaat , which has been shown to be required for their normal b-cell-specific transcription .
1,3 G#DNA|6,9 G#DNA

proteins that bind this octamer have been purified , and cdnas encoding octamer-binding proteins have been cloned .
10,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#protein

some of these proteins ( referred to as otf-2 ) are lymphoid specific , whereas at least one other , and possibly more ( referred to as otf-1 ) , is found ubiquitously in all cell types .
8,9 G#protein|27,28 G#protein

the exact role of these different proteins in directing the tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes is unclear .
13,15 G#DNA

we have identified two human pre-b-cell lines that contain extremely low levels of otf-2 yet still express high levels of steady-state immunoglobulin heavy-chain mrna in vivo and efficiently transcribe an immunoglobulin gene in vitro .
4,7 G#cell_line|13,14 G#protein|21,23 G#protein|20,24 G#RNA|30,32 G#DNA

addition of a highly enriched preparation of otf-1 made from one of these pre-b cells or from hela cells specifically stimulated in vitro transcription of an immunoglobulin gene .
7,8 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_line|17,19 G#cell_line|26,28 G#DNA

furthermore , oft-1 appeared to have approximately the same transactivation ability as otf-2 when normalized for binding activity .
12,13 G#protein

these results suggest that otf-1 , without otf-2 , is sufficient for transcription of immunoglobulin genes and that otf-2 alone is not responsible for the b-cell-specific regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression .

effects of aldosterone on intralymphocytic sodium and potassium in patients with essential hypertension .


in vitro binding of aldosterone to mineralocorticoid receptors on human mononuclear leukocytes ( hml ) and its effects on the intracellular sodium and potassium concentrations of hml have already been described .
6,8 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_type|13,14 G#cell_type|26,27 G#cell_type

in the present paper this easily accessible human cell model was investigated in 13 patients with essential hypertension .


in only four patients sodium in hml without incubation was elevated compared with the range for normal persons .
6,7 G#cell_type

a decrease of intracellular sodium or potassium occurred during incubation without aldosterone ( p less than 0.02 ) .


the addition of 1.4 nm aldosterone did not prevent this loss of electrolytes as observed in normal persons .


plasma renin activity and aldosterone were not correlated with the electrolyte response and were within the normal limits .
0,2 G#protein

the number of mineralocorticoid receptors /cell were within or close to the normal range ( n = 9 ) .
3,5 G#protein

the independence of intracellular electrolytes from aldosterone despite a normal number of mineralocorticoid receptors may reflect an impairment of the mineralocorticoid effector mechanism in the hml of patients with essential hypertension .

[ differential diagnostic value of receptors of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( calcitriol ) determination in lymphocytes of children with rickets and rickets -like diseases ]
14,15 G#cell_type

the authors provide the results of studying 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( calcitriol ) in lymphocytes of children with rickets and rickets -like diseases .
13,14 G#cell_type

it is proposed that the character of their expression under the influence of vitamin d may be used with differential diagnostic purposes in view .


regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides .


alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation .
8,11 G#protein

the functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods , each with specific limitations .


inhibition of sequence-specific dna-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded ( ds ) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa b consensus sequences .
2,5 G#protein|16,22 G#DNA

the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor ( nf ) -kappa b .
6,9 G#protein|10,17 G#protein

the modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner .


octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or nf-kappa b -dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected b cell line .
4,6 G#DNA|7,9 G#protein|13,20 G#DNA|31,36 G#cell_line

addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to jurkat t leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the il-2 enhancer .
7,9 G#DNA|10,14 G#cell_line|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|29,32 G#DNA|34,36 G#DNA

the ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral , immunosuppressive , or other therapeutic effects .


[ effect of the regimen of kidney-tonifying and qi-invigorating on aging changes of glucocorticoid receptor ]
13,15 G#protein

the plasma cortisol concentration and the sites of glucocorticoid receptor ( gcr ) in the peripheral lymphocytes were measured in 32 healthy aged persons and 13 young adults .
8,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|16,17 G#cell_type|15,17 G#cell_type

in animal experiment , gcr of spleen lymphocytic cell was also measured in 18 aged rats and 9 young rats .
4,5 G#protein|6,9 G#cell_type

the results showed that gcr was significantly lower in the aged persons or rats than that in the young while the plasma cortisol level did n't change with aging .
4,5 G#protein

so we think that gcr is more sensitive than the plasma cortisol level to reflect the aging change of the adrenal cortex function .
4,5 G#protein

after the treatment with the regimen of kidney-tonifying and qi-invigorating , the gcr of the aged persons and rats was enhanced , and in this way , the function of the aged adrenal cortex was improved .
12,13 G#protein

interferon affects nuclear proteins in cells of clinically sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia patients .
2,4 G#protein

cytoplasmic protein extracts from chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) cells contained an activity that altered the electrophoretic mobility of complexes formed between nuclear proteins and the transcriptional enhancers of interferon ( ifn ) -inducible genes .
4,11 G#cell_type|23,25 G#protein

exposure of cml cells to ifn-alpha diminished the effect of the cml cytoplasmic proteins on these nuclear protein-dna complexes .
2,4 G#cell_type|5,6 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|16,19 G#protein

the presence of clinical responsiveness to ifn-alpha correlated with the sensitivity to the ifn -induced change in the electrophoretic mobility of nuclear protein-dna complexes .
6,7 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|21,24 G#protein

these data suggest that the action of ifn-alpha in cml may be linked to a pathway that can result in posttranslational modification of nuclear proteins .

epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 2 transactivates latent membrane protein lmp1 .
0,5 G#protein|6,9 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

several lines of evidence are compatible with the hypothesis that epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) nuclear antigen 2 ( ebna-2 ) or leader protein ( ebna-lp ) affects expression of the ebv latent infection membrane protein lmp1 .
10,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|25,26 G#protein|31,36 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

we now demonstrate the following .


( i ) acute transfection and expression of ebna-2 under control of simian virus 40 or moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased lmp1 expression in p3hr-1-infected burkitt 's lymphoma cells and the p3hr-1 or daudi cell line .
8,9 G#protein|12,21 G#DNA|24,25 G#protein|27,32 G#cell_line|34,35 G#cell_line|36,39 G#cell_line

( ii ) transfection and expression of ebna-lp alone had no effect on lmp1 expression and did not act synergistically with ebna-2 to affect lmp1 expression .
7,8 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|24,25 G#protein

( iii ) lmp1 expression in daudi and p3hr-1-infected cells was controlled at the mrna level , and ebna-2 expression in daudi cells increased lmp1 mrna .
3,4 G#protein|6,7 G#cell_line|8,10 G#cell_line|14,15 G#RNA|18,19 G#protein|21,23 G#cell_line|24,25 G#protein|24,26 G#RNA

( iv ) no other ebv genes were required for ebna-2 transactivation of lmp1 since cotransfection of recombinant ebna-2 expression vectors and genomic lmp1 dna fragments enhanced lmp1 expression in the ebv-negative b-lymphoma cell lines bjab , louckes , and bl30 .
5,7 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|17,21 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein|23,26 G#DNA|27,28 G#protein|31,35 G#cell_line|35,36 G#cell_line|37,38 G#cell_line|40,41 G#cell_line

( v ) an ebna-2 -responsive element was found within the -512 to +40 lmp1 dna since this dna linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an ebna-2 expression vector .
4,5 G#protein|4,7 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA|11,16 G#DNA|22,24 G#protein|22,26 G#DNA|32,33 G#protein|32,35 G#DNA

( vi ) the ebv type 2 ebna-2 transactivated lmp1 as well as the ebv type 1 ebna-2 .
7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|14,18 G#protein

( vii ) two deletions within the ebna-2 gene which rendered ebv transformation incompetent did not transactivate lmp1 , whereas a transformation-competent ebna-2 deletion mutant did transactivate lmp1 .
7,8 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|21,25 G#DNA|27,28 G#protein

lmp1 is a potent effector of b-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with ebna-2 to induce cellular cd23 gene expression .
0,1 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

thus , ebna-2 transactivation of lmp1 amplifies the biological impact of ebna-2 and underscores its central role in ebv-induced growth transformation .

the expression of c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc genes is regulated by heat shock in human lymphoid cells .
3,4 G#DNA|5,6 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|16,19 G#cell_type

the effect of heat shock on the expression of the nuclear protooncogenes c-fos , c-jun , and c-myc was studied in human lymphoid cells .
10,12 G#DNA|12,13 G#DNA|14,15 G#DNA|17,18 G#DNA|21,24 G#cell_type

heat shock caused an increase in c-fos and c-jun mrna levels and a decrease in c-myc mrna levels in pre-b ( hyon ) and t ( dnd-41 ) cell lines as well as in freshly isolated normal human thymocytes .
15,16 G#DNA|15,17 G#RNA|19,30 G#cell_line

the changes in the mrna levels of these protooncogenes in hyon cells were most pronounced at 42 and 43 degrees c ; kinetic analysis demonstrated that the changes could be detected within 30 min of heat shock .
8,9 G#DNA|10,12 G#cell_line

altered transcription of c-fos and c-myc genes was the primary effect of heat shock .
3,4 G#DNA|5,6 G#DNA|5,7 G#DNA

secondarily , heat shock of hyon cells stabilized the c-myc mrna level by increasing its half-life from 24 to 45 min .
5,7 G#cell_line|9,10 G#DNA|9,11 G#RNA

the overall effect of heat shock on c-myc mrna level , however , was a marked inhibition of its transcription .
7,8 G#DNA|7,9 G#RNA

these results demonstrate that the transcription of nuclear protooncogenes is regulated by heat shock indicating a role for nuclear protooncogenes in the stress response of lymphoid cells .

mapping of b-cell epitopes of the human hepatitis b virus x protein .
2,4 G#protein|6,12 G#protein

the immune response to the x protein of human hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) was studied by epitope mapping by using a set of ms2-hbx fusion proteins and synthetic peptides .
5,7 G#protein|25,28 G#protein

antibodies in sera of patients with acute and chronic hbv infection showed a multispecific immune response .


each serum contained antibodies to a different set of epitopes , which taken together cover most of the hbx sequence .
3,4 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

some of the epitopes were detectable only by immunoblotting with fusion proteins ; others were detectable only by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) with synthetic peptides .
10,12 G#protein

the carboxy-terminal half of the hbx protein was preferentially recognized by antibodies from patients with chronic hepatitis and contained a short immunodominant antigenic region with at least two major nonoverlapping epitopes .
1,3 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|21,24 G#protein|29,31 G#protein

anti- hbx antibody titers as revealed by peptide elisas were highest and most frequent in patients with chronic hepatitis and usually low in acutely infected patients and asymptomatic carriers .
1,2 G#protein

the data demonstrate a remarkable qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the humoral hbx immune response which can be monitored by hbx -specific peptide elisas .
12,13 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

such tests may become useful diagnostic tools .


[ the inhibitory effect of hydrocortisone on the chemotactic migration of human leukocytes ]
11,13 G#cell_type

random migration ( rm ) and chemotactic migration ( chtm ) of human leukocytes to yeast activated serum were studied with the modified boyden chamber method .
12,14 G#cell_type

both rm and chtm showed circadian rhythm .


leukocytes migrated most rapidly at night .
0,1 G#cell_type

the difference between the peak ( 0 : 00 ) and trough values ( 8 : 00 ) of rm and chtm was significant statistically ( p less than 0.01 ) .


chtm was inhibited by hydrocortisone ( f ) of physiological concentration ( 10 ( -9 ) -10 ( -7 ) mol/l ) which was dose-dependent and completely antagonized by the competitive antagonist , ru38486 .


the inhibitory effect was much more evident with higher dose ( more than 10 ( -5 ) mol/l ) and it was also reversed by ru38486 , but only partially .


it is suggested that glucocorticoids ( gc ) may be a physiological regulator of the activity of leukocytes and its inhibitory action on chtm may be involved in antiinflammatory mechanisms of gc of pharmacological doses .
17,18 G#cell_type

the action of physiological and pharmacological concentration of gc may be mediated by low affinity specific binding sites of glucocorticoid receptors .

heterogeneity of antigen molecules recognized by anti-tax1 monoclonal antibody lt-4 in cell lines bearing human t cell leukemia virus type i and related retroviruses .
2,4 G#protein|6,9 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

using a monoclonal antibody , lt-4 , directed against human t cell leukemia virus type i ( htlv-i ) trans-activator ( tax1 ) antigen , we examined the expression of tax1 and related antigens in a variety of t cell lines bearing htlv-i and related retroviruses , simian t cell leukemia virus type i ( stlv-i ) and htlv-ii , by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays .
2,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|9,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|9,24 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|33,34 G#protein|38,41 G#cell_line

lt-4 reacted with all htlv-i -bearing cell lines tested and five out of eight simian cell lines bearing stlv-i , but not with an htlv-ii -bearing cell line .
0,1 G#protein|4,8 G#cell_line|14,17 G#cell_line|24,28 G#cell_line

lt-4 detected 40 kd tax1 antigen molecules in most htlv-i -bearing cell lines except one cell line that expressed 39 kd tax1 antigen .
0,1 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|9,13 G#cell_line|21,22 G#protein|19,23 G#protein

in the stlv-i -bearing t cell lines , tax1 -related antigen molecules detected by lt-4 were heterogeneous , having molecular weights in the range of 36-41 kd .

characterization of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer -binding proteins from the human t-cell line jurkat .
3,9 G#DNA|3,11 G#protein|13,16 G#cell_line|16,17 G#cell_line

the transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) is under the control of cellular proteins that bind to the viral long terminal repeat ( ltr ) .
17,19 G#protein|23,27 G#DNA|28,29 G#DNA

among the protein-binding regions of the hiv-1 ltr is the transcription-enhancer region .
6,8 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA

we show that at least one inducible , c1 , and one constitutive , c2 , protein can bind to the hiv enhancer in jurkat cells .
6,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|12,17 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA|24,26 G#cell_line

the two proteins differ in their surface charge , since they are separable by anion-exchange chromatography .


bivalent cations such as mg2+ and zn2+ differentially affect their binding to oligonucleotides which contain the hiv-enhancer domain .
16,18 G#DNA

both c1 and c2 proteins also bind to a similar sequence found in the interleukin-2 -receptor alpha-subunit enhancer .
1,2 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|14,18 G#DNA

the inducible c1 protein was partially purified by three chromatographic steps and characterized by u.v. cross-linking as a 47 kda protein .

differences in transcriptional enhancers of hiv-1 and hiv-2 .
2,4 G#DNA

response to t cell activation signals .
2,4 G#cell_type

t cell activation results in high levels of hiv replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection .
0,2 G#cell_type

in hiv-1 , the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat ( ltr ) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer , which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa b ( nf kappa b ) .
15,18 G#DNA|19,20 G#DNA|24,26 G#DNA|30,33 G#DNA|35,39 G#protein|40,43 G#protein

the corresponding region in the second aids retrovirus , hiv-2 , contains a conserved and a divergent nf kappa b binding site .
17,20 G#protein|17,22 G#DNA

we demonstrate that the hiv-1 ltr responds better than the hiv-2 ltr to t cell activation signals .
4,6 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA

these qualitative differences in the response to t cell activation are reproduced not only when hiv-1 or hiv-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective ltr .
7,9 G#cell_type|15,19 G#DNA|24,26 G#DNA|30,31 G#DNA|36,37 G#DNA

in electrophoretic mobility shift assays , nf kappa b binds to both conserved sites in the hiv-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the hiv-2 transcriptional enhancer .
6,9 G#protein|16,19 G#DNA|28,31 G#DNA

instead of nf kappa b , the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in hiv-2 .
2,5 G#protein|7,10 G#protein

in conclusion , hiv-1 and hiv-2 are differentially regulated by t cell activation signals , and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with hiv-2 than with hiv-1 infection .

10,11 G#protein

conserved upstream promoter sequences regulate this tissue-specific expression of class ii genes .
9,12 G#DNA

in the dra promoter , one of these cis-acting regulatory motifs is the x2-box to which nuclear factor x2 ( nf-x2 ) binds .
2,4 G#DNA|8,11 G#DNA|13,14 G#DNA|16,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

here , we present the isolation and characterization of the full-length cdna clone encoding nf-x2 .
10,13 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein

this cdna clone was isolated by expression cdna cloning , and encodes the human c-jun protein , which together with c-fos forms the heterodimeric activator protein-1 transcription complex .
1,3 G#DNA|7,8 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|13,16 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|23,28 G#protein

whereas c-fos /c-jun heterodimers do not exist in b cells , they form and bind to the x2-box in class ii nonexpressing cells .
1,2 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|1,4 G#protein|8,10 G#cell_line|17,18 G#DNA|19,23 G#cell_line

thus , c-fos /c-jun heterodimers might contribute to the repression of dra gene expression .

radioreceptor assay of some corticosteroid derivatives in human mononuclear leukocytes .
7,10 G#cell_type

several new 4,19-substituted steroids and previously synthesized corticosteroids were assayed for affinity to type 1 receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes .
13,16 G#protein|17,20 G#cell_type

11 beta,19-epoxy-4,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ( 2 ) was hydrogenated with pd-c to yield a mixture of all four dihydro derivatives 5 , accompanied by 4,21-diacetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one ( 6 ) and 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxy-4-hydroxypregnane-3,20-dione ( 7 ) .


with hot acetic + p-toluenesulfonic acid 5 underwent rearrangement to 21-acetoxy-11 beta,19-epoxypregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 8 ) pd-c hydrogenation of 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregna-2,9(11)-diene-4,20-dione ( 10 ) gave 3,21-diacetoxy-5 beta,19-cyclopregn-5-ene-4,20-dione ( 11 ) and the 9,11-dihydro derivative of the latter .


treatment of 10 with warm hcl furnished 19-chloro-4,21-dihydroxypregna-4,9(11)-diene-3,20-dione (13) .


pd-c hydrogenation of its diacetate 14 afforded the 4,5-dihydro derivative 18, 19-chloro-21-acetoxypregn-9(11)-en-20-one ( 15 ) , its 4-acetoxy derivative 16 and the 3,4-diacetoxy derivative 17 .


when tested in a radioreceptor assay in human mononuclear leukocytes the synthesized compounds showed only low relative binding affinities ( rba ) to type 1 receptor , the highest being 0.72 % for 13 ( aldosterone = 100 % ) .
7,10 G#cell_type|23,26 G#protein

for comparison , other rba in this system were : 19-noraldosterone , 20 % ; 18-deoxyaldosterone , 5.8 % ; 18-deoxy-19-noraldosterone , 4.7 % ; 18,21-anhydroaldosterone , 0.37 % ; 17-isoaldosterone , 7.6 % and apoaldosterone , 4.3 %


cell type specificity and activation requirements for nfat-1 ( nuclear factor of activated t-cells ) transcriptional activity determined by a new method using transgenic mice to assay transcriptional activity of an individual nuclear factor .
7,8 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type|32,34 G#protein

nuclear factor of activated t-cells ( nfat-1 ) is a transcription factor which is considered to be an important regulator in early t-cell activation .
0,2 G#protein|3,5 G#cell_type|6,7 G#protein|10,12 G#protein

we have developed a system to monitor the transcriptional activity of nfat-1 at the single cell level in whole animals .
11,12 G#protein

the system is based on the use of an oligomerized nfat-1 binding motif that directs transcription of sv40 t-antigen in transgenic mice .
10,11 G#protein|15,19 G#protein

this report represents the first demonstration that a multimerized short binding motif can function appropriately in transgenic mice .


nfat-1 activity had previously been thought to be confined to activated t-lymphocytes upon release of intracellular calcium .
0,1 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|15,17 G#cell_type

by targeting nfat-1 -dependent gene expression in transgenic mice we discovered new sites of nfat-1 activity .

besides in t-lymphocytes nfat-1 activity could also be induced in t-lymphocyte-depleted spleen cells and purified b-lymphocytes and requires agents that both release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase c .
2,3 G#cell_type|3,4 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_type|14,16 G#cell_type|26,29 G#protein

a difference in the time course of appearance of nfat-1 activity between t-lymphocytes and non-t-lymphocytes was revealed .
9,10 G#protein|12,13 G#cell_type|14,15 G#cell_type

constitutive expression was observed in a small population of cells in the dermis and some mice have developed skin lesions .


interestingly , the tissue pattern of expression of the nfat-1 activity resembles the expression pattern described for hiv-ltr/tat transgenic mice ( vogel , j. , hinrichs , s. h. , reynolds , r. k. , luciw , p. a. , and jay , g. ( 1988 ) nature 335 , 606-611 ) .

this similarity in expression and the fact that nfat-1 has been shown to bind functional sequences in hiv-ltr suggest a role for nfat-1 in dermal activation of the hiv-ltr .

a novel t-cell protein which recognizes a palindromic sequence in the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat .
2,4 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA|16,22 G#DNA

two major protein-binding sites within the negative regulatory element of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat have been identified .
1,4 G#DNA|6,9 G#DNA|11,19 G#DNA

one ( site b ) contained a palindromic sequence with homology to steroid/thyroid hormone response elements but was distinct from previously described binding sites of this class .
2,4 G#DNA|7,9 G#DNA|12,16 G#DNA

a novel t-cell protein recognized the palindromic sequence within site b and also bound estrogen- or thyroid hormone- response elements with lower affinity .
2,4 G#protein|6,8 G#DNA|9,11 G#DNA|14,20 G#DNA

progesterone suppression of pregnancy lymphocytes is not mediated by glucocorticoid effect .
3,5 G#cell_type

this study investigated whether the suppressive effect of progesterone on pregnancy lymphocytes is mediated by specific progesterone receptors .
10,12 G#cell_type|16,18 G#protein

the effects of a competitive progesterone antagonist ( ru486 ) and a specific glucocorticoid receptor blocker ( ru43044 ) were tested on the release of a blocking factor by progesterone -treated pregnancy lymphocytes .
13,15 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|31,33 G#cell_type|29,33 G#cell_line

ru 486 tested at an equal concentration as progesterone significantly inhibited the production of the blocking factor , while ru 43044 was without effect .
15,17 G#protein

these data suggest that in pregnancy , lymphocyte progesterone acts on specific progesterone receptors and glucocorticoid binding sites are not involved .

the 56-59-kilodalton protein identified in untransformed steroid receptor complexes is a unique protein that exists in cytosol in a complex with both the 70- and 90- kilodalton heat shock proteins .
1,3 G#protein|5,9 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|23,30 G#protein

it has previously been shown that 9s , untransformed progestin , estrogen , androgen , and glucocorticoid receptor complexes in rabbit uterine and liver cytosols contain a 59-kda protein [ tai , p.k. , maeda , y. , nakao , k. , wakim , n.g. , duhring , j.l. , &amp; faber , l.e.

6,7 G#protein|8,19 G#protein|27,29 G#protein

in this work we show that the monoclonal antibody kn 382/ec1 raised against the rabbit 59-kda protein reacts with 9s , untransformed glucocorticoid receptor complexes in cytosol prepared from human im-9 lymphocytes but not with 4s salt-transformed receptors .
7,11 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,25 G#protein|29,32 G#cell_line|35,38 G#protein

the human protein recognized by the ec1 antibody is a 56-kda protein ( p56 ) of moderate abundance located predominantly in the cytoplasm by indirect immunofluorescence .
6,8 G#protein|10,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

there are at least six isomorphs of p56 by two-dimensional gel analysis .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein

n-terminal sequencing ( 20 amino acids ) shows that p56 is a unique human protein .
9,10 G#protein|12,15 G#protein

when p56 is immunoadsorbed from im-9 cell cytosol , both the 70- and 90- kda heat shock proteins are coadsorbed in an immune-specific manner .
1,2 G#protein|5,7 G#cell_line|11,18 G#protein

neither heat shock protein reacts directly with the ec1 antibody .

we conclude that p56 exists in cytosol in a higher order complex containing hsp70 and hsp90 , both of which in turn have been found to be associated with untransformed steroid receptors .

in a study of cellular proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of murine retroviruses in t lymphocytes , we have discovered that a member of the ets gene family encodes a sequence-specific dna-binding protein .
4,6 G#protein|15,17 G#cell_type|26,29 G#DNA|31,34 G#protein

a mouse ets-1 cdna clone was obtained by screening a mouse thymus cdna expression library with a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe representing 20 bp of the moloney murine sarcoma virus ( msv ) long terminal repeat ( ltr ) .
2,3 G#protein|1,5 G#DNA|10,15 G#DNA|17,20 G#DNA|32,35 G#DNA|36,37 G#DNA

the cdna sequence has an 813-bp open reading frame ( orf ) whose predicted amino acid sequence is 97.6 % identical to the 272 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the human ets-1 protein .

a mutant ltr containing four base pair substitutions in the ets-1 binding site was constructed and was shown to have reduced binding in vitro .

transcriptional efficiency of the msv ltr promoter containing this disrupted ets-1 binding site was compared to the activity of a wild-type promoter in mouse t lymphocytes in culture , and 15- to 20-fold reduction in expression of a reporter gene was observed .

type ii estrogen binding sites in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells : variations during the menstrual cycle .
0,5 G#protein|6,11 G#cell_type

we have previously reported that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) contain type ii estrogen binding sites ( type ii ebs ) .
5,10 G#cell_type|11,12 G#cell_type|15,19 G#protein|20,23 G#protein

in this study , the fluctuations of type ii ebs during the menstrual cycle were analyzed in 6 normally menstruating women .
7,10 G#protein

approximately 3 times higher levels of type ii ebs were found in the periovulatory period with respect to both follicular and luteal phases .
6,9 G#protein

in postmenopausal women the mean type ii ebs levels were similar to those observed in the follicular phase of the cycle .

mononuclear leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor binding characteristics and down-regulation in major depression .
0,2 G#cell_type|2,4 G#protein

some patients with major depressive disorder ( mdd ) have elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and show failure to suppress cortisol secretion upon administration of dexamethasone ( dex ) , yet they do not have cushingoid features .


to study whether this represents glucocorticoid ( gc ) resistance , [3h]-dex-binding assays were used to measure , in vitro , the gc receptor affinity ( 1/kd ) and number ( bmax ) in mononuclear leukocytes of 11 mdd patients and 15 control subjects .
22,24 G#protein|34,36 G#cell_type

no receptor abnormalities were detected in the mdd group ; thus any cellular defect leading to a lack of responsiveness to gc in the mdd patients , if present , probably lies beyond the initial receptor binding .


dex ( 1.0 mg orally ) was administered to study in vivo gc receptor down-regulation .
11,14 G#protein

compared to the control group , fewer depressed subjects down-regulated bmax after dex .


by paired t-test , bmax decreased significantly in the control group but not in the depressed group .


receptor number on the control day did not correlate significantly with the degree of receptor down-regulation , severity of depression or cortisol concentrations across all the subjects .


these results do not lend support to previous reports suggesting that gc resistance in mdd results from a gc receptor-binding abnormality , and they emphasize the importance of considering receptor studies in the context of gc -mediated cell processes in order to identify the exact cellular defect ( s ) leading to gc resistance .

many aspects of leukocyte function are regulated by both heterotrimeric and ras-related gtp-binding proteins , but there is little definite information about their roles in the specialized processes utilized by leukocytes for cell killing .
3,4 G#cell_type|9,10 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|30,31 G#cell_type

recent progress in understanding the regulation of the phagocyte nadph oxidase by the rac gtp-binding proteins provides a basis for defining the operational characteristics of one such phagocyte system .
8,11 G#protein|13,16 G#protein

it is clear from various studies that the activity of the nadph oxidase can be modulated through the regulation of the gtp-gdp state of rac .

proteins exist in leukocytes able to modify gtp-binding protein function in this manner , and their activity may be regulated by signals generated on phagocyte stimulation .

they propose that bsap is a key protein of b cells and that it not only influence b-cell development but also influences the balance between b-cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion at later stages of b-cell differentiation .

down-regulation of nf-kappa b protein levels in activated human lymphocytes by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ published erratum appears in proc natl acad sci u s a 1996 jan 9 ; 93 ( 1 ) : 524 ]
2,5 G#protein

the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1,25(oh)2)d3 ] , a steroid hormone with immunomodulating properties , on nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-kappa b ) proteins was examined in in vitro activated normal human lymphocytes by western blot analysis .
17,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|33,35 G#cell_type|29,35 G#cell_line

over a 72-hr period of activation , the expression of the 50-kda nf-kappa b , p50 , and its precursor , p105 , was increased progressively .
11,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

when cells were activated in the presence of 1,25(oh)2d3 , the levels of the mature protein as well as its precursor were decreased .


the effect of the hormone on the levels of p50 was demonstrable in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments ; it required between 4 and 8 hr and was specific , as 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 were ineffective .
9,10 G#protein

besides p50 , 1,25(oh)2d3 decreased the levels of another nf-kappa b protein , namely c-rel .
1,2 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

9,12 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|24,29 G#protein

further , 1,25(oh)2d3 inhibited the transcriptional activity of nf-kappa b in jurkat cells transiently transfected with a construct containing four tandem repeats of the nf-kappa b binding sequence of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .
8,10 G#protein|11,13 G#cell_line|17,18 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA|24,26 G#protein|24,28 G#DNA|30,35 G#DNA|38,40 G#protein|38,42 G#DNA

these observations demonstrate directly that there is de novo synthesis of nf-kappa b during human lymphocyte activation and suggest that this process is hormonally regulated .

mzf-1 is a c2h2 zinc finger gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulator of myeloid differentiation .
0,1 G#DNA|3,7 G#DNA|9,12 G#protein

the mzf-1 protein contains 13 c2h2 zinc fingers arranged in bipartite dna binding domains containing zinc fingers through 4 and , in the carboxy-terminus , 5 through 13 .
1,2 G#DNA|5,8 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

we previously identified the dna consensus binding site recognized by the two dna binding domains .
4,8 G#DNA|12,15 G#protein

to assess the transcription regulatory function of mzf-1 , the full-length mzf-1 coding region was fused to the dna binding domain of the yeast transactivator gal4 .
7,8 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|18,21 G#protein|25,26 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

the expression vector was cotransfected with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( cat ) reporter gene regulated by the thymidine kinase promoter containing gal4 dna binding sites into nih 3t3 , 293 , k562 , and jurkat cell lines .

mzf-1 represses cat reporter gene expression via gal4 binding sites in the nonhematopoietic cell lines nih 3t3 and 293 .
0,1 G#DNA|2,5 G#DNA|7,8 G#protein|12,15 G#cell_line|15,17 G#cell_line|18,19 G#cell_line

in contrast , mzf-1 activates cat reporter gene expression in the hematopoietic cell lines k562 and jurkat .
3,4 G#DNA|5,8 G#DNA|11,14 G#cell_line|14,15 G#cell_line|16,17 G#cell_line

the mzf-1 binding sites are present in the promoters of several genes expressed during myeloid differentiation , including the cd34 promoter .
1,2 G#DNA|1,4 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA

mzf-1 transcriptional regulation of this physiologically relevant promoter was assessed in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines .
0,1 G#DNA|5,8 G#DNA|12,13 G#cell_line|14,17 G#cell_line

recombinant mzf-1 protein specifically binds to the consensus binding sites in the cd34 promoter in mobility shift assays .
1,2 G#DNA|0,3 G#protein|7,10 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA

mzf-1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids regulated by the cd34 promoter into both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic cell lines .
0,1 G#DNA|7,10 G#DNA|13,15 G#DNA|17,22 G#cell_line

as with the heterologous dna binding domain , mzf-1 represses reporter gene expression in nonhematopoietic cell lines and activates expression in hematopoietic cell lines .
4,7 G#protein|8,9 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|14,17 G#cell_line|21,24 G#cell_line

activation of cd34 expression in hematopoietic cell lines is dependent on the presence of intact mzf-1 binding sites .
2,3 G#protein|5,8 G#cell_line|15,16 G#DNA|15,18 G#DNA

the cell type-specific regulation of the cd34 promoter by mzf-1 suggests the presence of tissue-specific regulators/adapters or differential mzf-1 modifications that determine mzf-1 transcriptional regulatory function .

the bcl6 gene has been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint in these lymphomas .

here we cloned the murine bcl6 ( mbcl6 ) cdna from the muscle cdna library using the human bcl6 ( hbcl6 ) cdna as a probe .
4,6 G#protein|4,10 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA|17,19 G#protein|17,23 G#DNA

the predicted amino acid sequence was 95 % identical to that of hbcl6 .

it contains six repeats of the kruppel-like zinc-finger motif that are completely identical to those of hbcl6 , indicating that the bcl6 gene is well conserved between humans and mice .

this induction was not inhibited by treatment of the cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor , cycloheximide .


these results suggest that bcl6 plays a role in activated lymphocytes as an immediate early gene .

the dna-binding properties of two heat shock factors , hsf1 and hsf3 , are induced in the avian erythroblast cell line hd6 .
4,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|17,21 G#cell_line|21,22 G#cell_line

avian cells express three heat shock transcription factor ( hsf ) genes corresponding to a novel factor , hsf3 , and homologs of mouse and human hsf1 and hsf2 .
4,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|4,12 G#DNA|15,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

analysis of the biochemical and cell biological properties of these hsfs reveals that hsf3 has properties in common with both hsf1 and hsf2 and yet has features which are distinct from both .
10,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

hsf3 is constitutively expressed in the erythroblast cell line hd6 , the lymphoblast cell line msb , and embryo fibroblasts , and yet its dna-binding activity is induced only upon exposure of hd6 cells to heat shock .
0,1 G#protein|6,10 G#cell_line|12,16 G#cell_line|18,20 G#cell_line

acquisition of hsf3 dna-binding activity in hd6 cells is accompanied by oligomerization from a non-dna-binding dimer to a dna-binding trimer , whereas the effect of heat shock on hsf1 is oligomerization of an inert monomer to a dna-binding trimer .

induction of hsf3 dna-binding activity is delayed compared with that of hsf1 .
2,3 G#protein|11,12 G#protein

as occurs for hsf1 , heat shock leads to the translocation of hsf3 to the nucleus .
3,4 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

hsf exhibits the properties of a transcriptional activator , as judged from the stimulatory activity of transiently overexpressed hsf3 measured by using a heat shock element-containing reporter construct and as independently assayed by the activity of a chimeric gal4 -hsf3 protein on a gal4 reporter construct .

nuclear factor of activated t cells ( nfat ) regulates transcription of a number of cytokine genes , and nfat dna binding activity is stimulated following t cell activation .
0,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|19,20 G#protein

several lines of evidence have suggested that nfat is a substrate for calcineurin , a serine/threonine phosphatase .
7,8 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

using a polyclonal antibody to murine nfatp , western blot analysis of various mouse tissues demonstrated that the 110-130-kda nfatp protein was highly expressed in thymus and spleen .
6,7 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

treatment of immunoprecipitated nfatp from untreated ht-2 cells with calcineurin resulted in the dephosphorylation of nfatp , demonstrating that nfatp is an in vitro substrate for calcineurin .
3,4 G#protein|6,8 G#cell_line|9,10 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

nfatp immunoprecipitated from 32p-labeled ht-2 cells migrated as an approximately 120-kda protein that was localized to the cytosol of the cells .
0,1 G#protein|4,6 G#cell_line|3,6 G#cell_line

treatment of the cells with ionomycin resulted in a decrease in the molecular weight of nfatp and a loss of 32p , consistent with nfatp dephosphorylation .
15,16 G#protein|24,25 G#protein

the dephosphorylation of nfatp was accompanied by localization of the protein to the nuclear fraction .
3,4 G#protein

both of these events were blocked by preincubation of the cells with fk506 , a calcineurin inhibitor , consistent with the hypothesis that nfatp is a calcineurin substrate in cells .

the putative factors that couple the signal transduction from surface receptors to the activation of cytokine synthesis in natural killer ( nk ) cells have not been elucidated .
15,16 G#protein|18,24 G#cell_type

we report here that the nuclear factor of activated t cells ( nfatp ) , a cyclosporin a ( csa ) -sensitive factor that regulates the transcription of several cytokines , mediates cd16 -induced activation of cytokine genes in human nk cells .

0,1 G#protein|2,5 G#protein|9,11 G#RNA|12,14 G#cell_type

stimulation of nk cells with cd16 ligands induces nfat -like dna binding activity in the nuclear extracts from these cells , as detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .
2,4 G#cell_type|5,6 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

this occurs with fast kinetics after stimulation , via a csa -sensitive and ca(2+)-dependent mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis .


nk cell nfat is present in the cytosol of nonstimulated cells , migrates to the nucleus upon stimulation , and can associate with ap-1 .
0,3 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_type|23,24 G#protein

two distinct molecules , nfatp and nfatc , have been reported to mediate nfat activity .

the results of supershift assays using nfatp- and nfatc- specific antibodies indicate that nk cell activation early after cd16 ligand binding involves primarily , if not exclusively , nfatp , and western blot analysis shows that this has the same electrophoretic mobility ( approximately 120 kd ) as that of t lymphocytes .
6,11 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|50,52 G#cell_type

nk cells do not express nfatc constitutively , but nfatc mrna accumulation is induced in these cells within 2 h of stimulation with cd16 ligands .
0,2 G#cell_type|5,6 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#RNA

however , supershift assays using the available mab recognizing the t cell nfatc revealed no detectable nfatc protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from cd16- or phorbol ester -stimulated cells at any time tested , up to 4 h .
7,8 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|10,13 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|26,30 G#cell_line

these results provide the first direct evidence that both csa -sensitive transcription factors , nfatp and nfatc , are expressed in human nk cells , and that their activation and/or expression can be regulated in primary cells by a single stimulus , that , in the case of cd16 in nk cells , results in early activation of nfatp and subsequently induced expression of nfatc mrna .

interleukin 2 signaling involves the phosphorylation of stat proteins .
7,9 G#protein

one of the most important cytokines involved in immune response regulation is interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) , a potent activator of the proliferation and function of t lymphocytes and natural killer cells .
5,6 G#protein|28,29 G#cell_type|27,29 G#cell_type|30,33 G#cell_type

the mechanisms by which the effects of il-2 are propagated within cells are not understood .
7,8 G#protein

while the binding of il-2 to its receptor was recently shown to lead to the activation of two kinases , jak-1 and jak-3 , subsequent steps in the signaling pathway to the nucleus that lead to the activation of specific genes had not been characterized .
4,5 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

since many cytokines that activate jak kinases also lead to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of members of the stat family of transcription factors , the ability of il-2 to trigger stat phosphorylation was examined .
2,3 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

exposure of activated human t lymphocytes or of a natural killer cell line ( nkl ) to il-2 leads to the phosphorylation of stat1 alpha , stat1 beta , and stat3 , as well as of two stat-related proteins , p94 and p95 .
4,6 G#cell_type|3,6 G#cell_type|9,12 G#cell_type|9,13 G#cell_line|14,15 G#cell_line|17,18 G#protein|23,25 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|37,39 G#protein|40,41 G#protein|42,43 G#protein

p94 and p95 share homology with stat1 at the phosphorylation site and in the src homology 2 ( sh2 ) domain , but otherwise are immunologically distinct from stat1 .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|14,21 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

these stat proteins were found to translocate to the nucleus and to bind to a specific dna sequence .
1,3 G#protein|15,18 G#DNA

these findings suggest a mechanism by which il-2 binding to its receptor may activate specific genes involved in immune cell function .

expression of c-fos correlates with ifn-alpha responsiveness in philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia .
2,3 G#DNA|5,6 G#protein

this study evaluates ( i ) constitutive levels of oncogene and p53 transcripts in chronic phase cml patients and ( ii ) their modulations subsequent to in vivo therapy with rifn-alpha 2c .
9,10 G#DNA|11,13 G#RNA|30,32 G#protein

peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) and bone marrow cells of 26 patients were examined for c-fos , c-myc , p53 and the hybrid bcr/abl mrna levels .
0,4 G#cell_type|5,6 G#cell_type|8,11 G#cell_type

results indicated that ( i ) constitutive c-fos transcript levels are significantly higher in patients subsequently responding to ifn-alpha therapy ( p &lt; 0.01 ) and positively correlated with the proportion of lymphocytes ( r = 0.6895 , p &lt; 0.01 ) and negatively with the proportion of immature cells ( r = -0.568 , p &lt; 0.01 ) contained in the pbmc preparations tested , ( ii ) constitutive mrna levels of the hybrid bcr/abl , c-myc and p53 are positively correlated with each other , but failed to relate to disease parameters , and ( iii ) acute and chronic in vivo exposure to ifn-alpha is accompanied by upregulation of c-fos and downregulation of c-myc mrna levels in responder patients .

menopause is associated with a significant increase in blood monocyte number and a relative decrease in the expression of estrogen receptors in human peripheral monocytes .
19,21 G#protein|22,25 G#cell_type

problem : the clinical significance of the differential expression of estrogen receptor ( er ) in human monocytes was evaluated .
10,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|16,18 G#cell_type

method : two color flow cytometry analysis was used on peripheral blood samples of young and postmenopausal females and postmenopausal females treated with estrogen replacement therapy .


in addition , the monocyte and lymphocyte counts and the blood estrogen levels of each patient were determine .


results : during menopause there is a significant decrease in the percentage of er positive monocytes , and an increase in blood monocyte number , which declines following estrogen replacement therapy to values of the young .
13,14 G#protein|13,16 G#cell_type|22,23 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_type

conclusions : these findings suggest that estrogen modulates the monocyte numbers and its effects may be mediated through the er in the monocytes .

staphylococcal enterotoxins modulate interleukin 2 receptor expression and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the janus protein- tyrosine kinase 3 ( jak3 ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( stat proteins ) .
0,2 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|13,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|22,28 G#protein|29,31 G#protein

staphylococcal enterotoxins ( se ) stimulate t cells expressing the appropriate variable region beta chain of ( v beta ) t-cell receptors and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases .
0,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein|6,8 G#cell_type|11,15 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|11,22 G#protein

depending on costimulatory signals , se induce either proliferation or anergy in t cells .
5,6 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type

in addition , se can induce an interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) nonresponsive state and apoptosis .
3,4 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

here , we show that se induce dynamic changes in the expression of and signal transduction through the il-2 receptor ( il-2r ) beta and gamma chains ( il-2r beta and il-2r gamma ) in human antigen-specific cd4+ t-cell lines .
5,6 G#protein|18,27 G#protein|28,30 G#protein|31,33 G#protein|35,40 G#cell_line

thus , after 4 hr of exposure to sea and seb , the expression of il-2r beta was down-regulated , il-2r gamma was slightly up-regulated , while il-2r alpha remained largely unaffected .
8,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|27,29 G#protein

the changes in the composition of il-2rs were accompanied by inhibition of il-2 -induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the janus protein- tyrosine kinase 3 ( jak3 ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription called stat3 and stat5 .
6,7 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|18,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|27,33 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

in parallel experiments , il-2 -driven proliferation was inhibited significantly .
4,5 G#protein

after 16 hr of exposure to se , the expression of il-2r beta remained low , while that of il2r alpha and il2r gamma was further up-regulated , and ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of jak3 and stat proteins was partly normalized .
6,7 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|33,34 G#protein|35,37 G#protein

yet , il-2 -driven proliferation remained profoundly inhibited , suggesting that signaling events other than jak3 /stat activation had also been changed following se stimulation .
2,3 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

in conclusion , our data suggest that se can modulate il-2r expression and signal transduction involving the jak/stat pathway in cd4+ t-cell lines .

constitutive nf-kappa b activation , enhanced granulopoiesis , and neonatal lethality in i kappa b alpha -deficient mice .
1,3 G#protein|12,16 G#protein

transcription factors belonging to the nf-kappa b family are controlled by inhibitory i kappa b proteins , mainly i kappa b alpha and i kappa b beta .
0,2 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|5,8 G#protein|11,16 G#protein|18,22 G#protein|23,27 G#protein

apparently normal at birth , i kappa b alpha -/- mice exhibit severe runting , skin defects , and extensive granulopoiesis postnatally , typically dying by 8 days .
5,9 G#protein

hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both nuclear nf-kappa b and mrnas of some , but not all , genes thought to be regulated by nf-kappa b .
11,13 G#protein|10,13 G#protein|14,15 G#RNA|28,30 G#protein

nf-kappa b elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice lacking both i kappa b alpha and the p50 subunit of nf-kappa b show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities .
0,2 G#protein|12,16 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|21,23 G#protein

in contrast to hematopoietic cells , i kappa b alpha -/- embryonic fibroblasts show minimal constitutive nf-kappa b , as well as normal signal-dependent nf-kappa b activation that is concomitant with i kappa b beta degradation .
3,5 G#cell_type|6,10 G#protein|6,13 G#cell_line|16,18 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|31,35 G#protein

our results indicate that i kappa b beta , but not i kappa b alpha , is required for the signal-dependent activation of nf-kappa b in fibroblasts .
11,15 G#protein|23,25 G#protein|26,27 G#cell_type

however , i kappa b alpha is required for the postinduction repression of nf-kappa b in fibroblasts .
2,6 G#protein|13,15 G#protein|16,17 G#cell_type

these results define distinct roles for the two forms of i kappa b and demonstrate the necessity for stringent control of nf-kappa b .

interleukin-7 can induce the activation of jak 1 , jak 3 and stat 5 proteins in murine t cells .
0,1 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|12,15 G#protein|17,19 G#cell_type

the activation of janus protein tyrosine kinases ( jak ) and stat ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) proteins has recently been linked to the signal transduction mechanism of several cytokines .
3,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,19 G#protein|11,21 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

il-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of jak 1 and jak 3 and concomitantly , the tyrosine phosphorylation and dna binding activity of multiple stat proteins .
0,1 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|29,31 G#protein

the stat proteins utilized by il-7 were identical to those induced by il-2 and could be identified as various stat 5 isoforms .
1,3 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|19,22 G#protein

moreover , the induction of both jak 1 and 3 , and stat 5 activity strongly correlated with the growth-promoting effects of il-7 , suggesting that this signal transduction mechanism may play a key role in il-7 -induced proliferation .
6,10 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

cytokine -modulating activity of tepoxalin , a new potential antirheumatic .
0,1 G#protein

tepoxalin is a new dual cyclooxygenase/5-lipoxygenase anti-inflammatory compound currently under clinical investigation .


it has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity in a variety of animal models and more recently to inhibit il-2 induced signal transduction .
19,20 G#protein

the current study was conducted to evaluate the cytokine modulating activity of tepoxalin and the role of iron in these effects .
8,9 G#protein

in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) stimulated with okt3/pma , tepoxalin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation with an ic50 of 6 microm .
1,6 G#cell_type|7,8 G#cell_type|15,16 G#cell_type

additionally , it inhibited the production of ltb4 ( ic50 = 0.5 microm ) and the cytokines il-2 , il-6 and tnf alpha ( ic50 = 10-12 microm ) .
7,8 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,23 G#protein

cytotoxicity was not demonstrated at these concentrations .


add-back experiments with either cytokines ( il-2 or il-6 ) , ltb4 or conditioned media failed to restore the proliferative response in the presence of tepoxalin .
4,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein

however , the concurrent addition of iron ( in the form of ferrous or ferric chloride and other iron salts ) reversed the inhibition of proliferation caused by tepoxalin .


tepoxalin also inhibits the activation of nf kappa b , a transcription factor which acts on several cytokine genes .
6,9 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|17,19 G#DNA

tepoxalin 's effect on nf kappa b is also reversed by the addition of iron salts .
4,7 G#protein

these data suggest that the action of tepoxalin to inhibit proliferation in pbmc may be at least in part due to its ability to reduce the amount of available iron resulting in decreased activation of nf kappa b and subsequent inhibition of cytokine production .
12,13 G#cell_type|35,38 G#protein|42,43 G#protein

n- and c-terminal sequences control degradation of mad3/ i kappa b alpha in response to inducers of nf-kappa b activity .
0,4 G#protein|8,12 G#protein|7,12 G#protein|17,19 G#protein

the proteolytic degradation of the inhibitory protein mad3/ i kappa b alpha in response to extracellular stimulation is a prerequisite step in the activation of the transcription factor nf-kappa b .
5,7 G#protein|8,12 G#protein|7,12 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|28,30 G#protein

analysis of the expression of human i kappa b alpha protein in stable transfectants of mouse 70z/3 cells shows that , as for the endogenous murine protein , exogenous i kappa b alpha is degraded in response to inducers of nf-kappa b activity , such as phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide .
6,10 G#protein|5,11 G#protein|15,18 G#cell_line|29,33 G#protein|40,42 G#protein

in addition , pretreatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor n-ac-leu-leu-norleucinal inhibits this ligand-induced degradation and , in agreement with previous studies , stabilizes a hyperphosphorylated form of the human i kappa b alpha protein .
9,10 G#protein|31,35 G#protein|30,36 G#protein

by expressing mutant forms of the human protein in this cell line , we have been able to delineate the sequences responsible for both the ligand-induced phosphorylation and the degradation of i kappa b alpha .
10,12 G#cell_line|31,35 G#protein

our results show that deletion of the c terminus of the i kappa b alpha molecule up to amino acid 279 abolishes constitutive but not ligand-inducible phosphorylation and inhibits ligand-inducible degradation .
7,9 G#protein|11,15 G#protein|18,21 G#protein

further analysis reveals that the inducible phosphorylation of i kappa b alpha maps to two serines in the n terminus of the protein ( residues 32 and 36 ) and that the mutation of either residue is sufficient to abolish ligand-induced degradation , whereas both residues must be mutated to abolish inducible phosphorylation of the protein .

microtubules mediate cellular 25-hydroxyvitamin d3 trafficking and the genomic response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 in normal human monocytes .
0,1 G#protein|15,17 G#cell_type

the genomic actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( 1,25(oh)2d3 ) are mediated by the intracellular vitamin d receptor ( vdr ) .
14,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

although immunocytochemistry has shown that disruption of microtubular assembly prevents nuclear access of the sterol- vdr complex , the role of microtubules in the response to 1,25(oh)2d3 has not been studied in viable cells .
15,16 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|32,34 G#cell_type

our studies examined this interaction in normal human monocytes .
7,9 G#cell_type

monocytes convert 25(oh)d3 to 1,25(oh)2d3 and to 24-hydroxylated metabolites more polar than 1,25(oh)2d3 .


microtubule disruption totally abolished the ability of exogenous 1,25(oh)2d3 to suppress its own synthesis and to induce 24-hydroxylase mrna and activity , without affecting either total 1,25(oh)2d3 uptake or maximal 1,25(oh)2d3 -vdr binding .
17,19 G#RNA|31,32 G#protein

thus , intact microtubules are essential for 1,25(oh)2d3 -dependent modulation of gene transcription .
3,4 G#protein

interestingly , microtubule disruption also decreased monocyte 1,25(oh)2d3 synthesis , not by decreasing the vmax of monocyte mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase but through an increase in the km for 25(oh)2d3 .
2,3 G#protein|6,7 G#cell_type|16,17 G#cell_type|16,20 G#protein

we examined 25(oh)d3 transport .


microtubule disruption did not affect total cellular 25(oh)d3 uptake but reduced its intracellular trafficking to the mitochondria .


thus , microtubules participate in intracellular 25(oh)d3 transport , and their integrity determines normal 1,25(oh)2d3 synthesis .

relationship between rap1 protein phosphorylation and regulation of ca2+ transport in platelets : a new approach .
2,4 G#protein|11,12 G#cell_type

although the interrelationship between the two messengers ca2+ and cyclic amp in platelet function is well documented , its mechanism of action still remains to be established .


we investigated here the question of the regulation of platelet ca(2+)-atpases by cyclic amp through the phosphorylation of the rap1 protein using a pathological model .
9,11 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

we first found experimental conditions where ca(2+)-transport by platelet membrane vesicles appeared to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the rap1 protein .
20,22 G#protein

then , we studied platelets of patients with congestive heart failure for their expression of the potential 97 kda ca(2+)-atpase target of regulation through the rap1 protein as well as the phosphorylation of the rap1 protein using the catalytic subunit of the cyclic amp -dependent protein kinase ( c. sub. ) .
4,5 G#cell_type|19,20 G#protein|17,21 G#protein|25,27 G#protein|34,36 G#protein|38,40 G#protein|42,47 G#protein|48,50 G#protein

in the first patients studied , we found no significant modification in the expression of the 97 kda ca(2+)-atpase by western blotting using the pl/im 430 monoclonal antibody which specifically recognized this isoform .
16,19 G#protein|24,28 G#protein

in contrast , the rap1 protein was differentially phosphorylated when using 15 micrograms/ml of the c. sub .
4,6 G#protein|15,18 G#protein

these results allowed us to use these pathological platelets to study the relationship between the expression of rap1 protein and the regulation of ca2+ transport by selecting a patient with severe heart failure .
8,9 G#cell_type|17,19 G#protein

we could show a decrease in the expression as well as in the phosphorylation of rap1 protein and demonstrate a lower effect of c. sub. on ca2+ transport .
15,17 G#protein|23,25 G#protein

finally , by studying a further series of patients , we could confirm that the decrease in rap1 protein expression in heart failure , whatever its extent , was variable , and could strictly correlate the expression of rap1 protein with the stimulatory effect of c. sub. on ca2+ transport .
17,19 G#protein|38,40 G#protein|45,47 G#protein

besides the evidence for regulation of the expression of the rap1 protein in platelets from patients with heart failure , these findings constitute a new approach in favour of the regulation of platelet ca2+ transport through the phosphorylation of the rap1 protein .

an irf-1 -dependent pathway of dna damage-induced apoptosis in mitogen-activated t lymphocytes .
1,2 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_line

lymphocytes are particularly susceptible to dna damage-induced apoptosis , a response which may serve as a form of ' altruistic suicide ' to counter their intrinsic high potential for mutation and clonal expansion .
0,1 G#cell_line

the tumour suppressor p53 has been shown to regulate this type of apoptosis in thymocytes , but an as yet unknown , p53 -independent pathway ( s ) appears to mediate the same event in mitogen-activated mature t lymphocytes .
1,4 G#protein|14,15 G#cell_type|22,23 G#protein|35,39 G#cell_line

here we show dna damage-induced apoptosis in these t lymphocytes is dependent on the antioncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor ( irf ) -1 .
8,10 G#cell_type|15,17 G#protein|14,20 G#protein|20,24 G#protein

thus two different anti-onco-genic transcription factors , p53 and irf-1 , are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in t lymphocytes .
3,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|18,20 G#cell_type

we also show that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme ( ice ) gene , a mammalian homologue of the caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3 , is irf-1 -dependent .
8,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|8,16 G#DNA|18,20 G#protein|22,27 G#DNA|27,28 G#DNA|30,31 G#protein

ectopic overexpression of irf-1 results in the activation of the endogenous gene for ice and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis .

circadian rhythm of glucocorticoid receptors in human peripheral leukocytes and their reactivity to glucocorticoids .
3,5 G#protein|6,9 G#cell_type

1 ) there exists a cr of gr in human leukocytes , pmn , and monocytes with the peak values from 0400 to 0800 hr and the trough values between 2300 and 0000 hr .
7,8 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_type|12,13 G#cell_type|15,16 G#cell_type

the difference between them was significant statistically .


2 ) the fi of the chemotactic migration rate of pmn by cortisol also showed diurnal changes which were synchronous with that of gr .
10,11 G#cell_type|23,24 G#protein

this indicates that the cr of gr may be of functional significance .
6,7 G#protein

3 ) in cushing 's syndrome , the cr of gr was normal in spite of the fact that the cr of plasma cortisol was disturbed .
10,11 G#protein

this indicates the independency of the cr of gr from that of cortisol .
8,9 G#protein

4 ) in apoplexy caused by brain ischemia , the cr of gr was abolished in patients with basal lesions but preserved when the lesions were located in the cerebral cortex .
12,13 G#protein

these results strongly suggest that the main " circadian pacemaker " of gr is located in the basal brain , most probably in the suprachiasmatic nuclei as has been suggested for rodents .

b-lymphoblastoid cell lines from multiple sclerosis patients and a healthy control producing a putative new human retrovirus and epstein-barr virus .
0,3 G#cell_line

on several occasions we have observed retrovirus-like particles ( rvlps ) by transmission electron microscopy ( em ) of cultured t cells from a patient with ms .
19,22 G#cell_line

later we established spontaneously formed b-lymphoblastoid cell lines ( lcls ) from a patient with an ms -like disease and from another patient with ms who had a reactivated epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) infection .
5,8 G#cell_line|9,10 G#cell_line

both lcls were found by em to produce rvlp and ebv particles .
1,2 G#cell_line

reverse transcriptase ( rt ) assays were positive in purified viral material from both lcls .
14,15 G#cell_line

to substantiate these findings we initiated an intensified culturing procedure and were able to establish lcls from 5 out of 21 consecutive ms patients and 1 out of 13 consecutive healthy controls .
15,16 G#cell_line

all lcls were found to produce both rvlp and ebv particles by em .
1,2 G#cell_line

whether the putative new retrovirus ( es ) and ebv have any causal relationship to ms is still not known , but the findings support this possibility .

activation through the ca2+ / calcineurin pathway is essential to the transcription of many cytokine genes .
5,6 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA

the conserved cis-acting sequence , ggaaaa , and transcription factors binding to this sequence are involved in the response to increased intracellular ca2+ concentrations .
1,4 G#DNA|8,10 G#protein

here we report the identification and importance of the same sequence in a non-cytokine gene , the human t cell receptor gamma ( tcrg ) enhancer .
13,15 G#DNA|17,20 G#cell_type|17,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|17,26 G#DNA

results from site-directed mutations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays strongly suggest that this sequence mediates the ionomycin -induced activation of the tcrg enhancer .
21,23 G#DNA

our studies provide an explanation for a previous observation that tcrg mrna levels , but not mrna levels for t cell receptor alpha and -beta , are increased by ionomycin treatment .

coexpression of nf-kappa b /rel and sp1 transcription factors in human immunodeficiency virus 1 -induced , dendritic cell-t-cell syncytia .
2,4 G#protein|2,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|7,9 G#protein

productive infection of t cells with human immunodeficiency virus 1 ( hiv-1 ) typically requires that the t cells be stimulated with antigens or mitogens .
3,5 G#cell_type|17,19 G#cell_type

this requirement has been attributed to the activation of the transcription factor nf-kappa b , which synergizes with the constitutive transcription factor sp1 to drive the hiv-1 promoter .
10,12 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|19,22 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|26,28 G#DNA

recently , we have found that vigorous replication of hiv-1 takes place in nonactivated memory t cells after syncytium formation with dendritic cells ( dcs ) .
15,17 G#cell_type|14,17 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_type|24,25 G#cell_type

these syncytia lack activated cells as determined by an absence of staining for ki-67 cell cycle antigen .

the expression and activity of nf-kappa b and sp1 were , therefore , analyzed in isolated t cells and dcs from humans and mice .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|16,18 G#cell_type|19,20 G#cell_type

we have used immunolabeling , western blot analysis , and electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays .


t cells lack active nf-kappa b but express sp1 as expected .
0,2 G#cell_type|4,6 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

dcs express high levels of all known nf-kappa b and rel proteins , with activity residing primarily within relb , p50 , and p65 .
0,1 G#cell_type|7,9 G#protein|10,12 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

however , dcs lack sp1 , which may explain the failure of hiv-1 to replicate in purified dcs .
2,3 G#cell_type|4,5 G#protein|17,18 G#cell_type

coexpression of nf-kappa b and sp1 occurs in the heterologous dc-t-cell syncytia that are induced by hiv-1 .
2,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_type

therefore , hiv-1 -induced cell fusion brings together factors that upregulate virus transcription .


since dcs and memory t cells frequently traffic together in situ , these unusual heterologous syncytia could develop in infected individuals and lead to chronic hiv-1 replication without ostensible immune stimulation .

cupric ion blocks nf kappa b activation through inhibiting the signal-induced phosphorylation of i kappa b alpha .
3,6 G#protein|13,17 G#protein

a transcription factor nf kappa b , which regulates expression of various cellular genes involved in immune responses and viral genes including hiv , is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a complex with an inhibitory protein i kappa b .
1,3 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|19,21 G#DNA|34,39 G#protein

various extracellular signals induce phosphorylation and rapid degradation of i kappa b alpha to release nf kappa b .
9,13 G#protein|15,18 G#protein

cu2+ was found to inhibit the activation of nf kappa b induced by tnf-alpha , tpa , or h2o2 .
8,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

deoxycholate treatment of the cytoplasmic extract prepared from cells stimulated by tnf-alpha in the presence of cu2+ resulted in the release of nf kappa b from i kappa b alpha , indicating that cu2+ interferes with the dissociation of the nf kappa b -i kappa b complex .
11,12 G#protein|22,25 G#protein|26,30 G#protein|40,43 G#protein|40,47 G#protein

neither phosphorylation nor degradation of i kappa b alpha was observed upon tnf-alpha stimulation in the presence of cu2+ .
5,9 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

these results indicate that cu2+ inhibits the release of nf kappa b by blockade of a signal leading to the phosphorylation of i kappa b alpha .

cloning a cdna from human nk/ t cells which codes for a protein with high proline content .
2,3 G#DNA|6,8 G#cell_type|5,8 G#cell_type

a cdna clone , b4-2 , was isolated from a natural killer ( nk ) minus t cell subtractive library .
1,3 G#DNA|4,5 G#DNA|10,20 G#DNA

the b4-2 clone coded for an mrna of 2061 bp in length .
1,2 G#DNA|6,7 G#RNA

it encodes a deduced 327 aa protein with a calculated molecular mass of 35.2 kda .
4,7 G#protein

searching of b4-2 dna and protein sequences against various databases revealed no high homology to other sequences .
2,3 G#DNA|2,4 G#DNA

however , b4-2 has an unusually high proline content ( 13 % ) , contains a putative nuclear targeting sequence , and has several spxx motifs which are frequently found in gene regulatory proteins .
2,3 G#DNA|17,20 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|31,34 G#protein

one of the stretches of prolines in b4-2 closely resembles the ligand for proteins with sh3 domains .
7,8 G#DNA|15,17 G#protein

northern hybridization data showed that b4-2 is not a lymphoid specific gene and is expressed in a hepatoma cell line and also weakly transcribed or absent in a variety of other cells .

activation of jak3 , but not jak1 , is critical for il-2 -induced proliferation and stat5 recruitment by a cooh-terminal region of the il-2 receptor beta-chain .
2,3 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

a number of cytokines and growth factors use the jak -stat pathway to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus .
3,4 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|10,11 G#protein

while homodimerizing cytokine receptors may transmit signal via a single form of jak ( i.e. growth hormone receptors ) , several multicomponent cytokine receptors have been shown to require simultaneous activation of pairs of different jak kinases ( i.e. interferon receptors ) .
1,4 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|21,24 G#protein|35,37 G#protein|39,41 G#protein

recent evidence for a preferential coupling of jak3 to interleukin-2 receptor-gamma ( il-2r gamma ) and jak1 to il-2r beta supports the concept of heterotrans-activation of jak1 and jak3 caused by il-2 -induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners .
7,8 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|31,32 G#protein

the present study verified the ability of il-2 to cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of jak1 and jak3 , but demonstrated that il-2 stimulated jak3 to a significantly larger extent than jak1 in human t lymphocytes and the yt cell line .
7,8 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|33,36 G#cell_type|38,41 G#cell_line

this conclusion was based upon several independent criteria , including more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of jak3 , more marked enzymatic activation of jak3 as well as higher abundance of jak3 in activated il-2 receptor complexes .
15,16 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|32,35 G#protein

furthermore , when human il-2r beta was stably expressed in murine ba/f3 cells , robust il-2 -induced proliferation and jak3 activation occurred without detectable involvement of either jak1 , jak2 or tyk2 .
4,5 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_line|15,16 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|31,32 G#protein

we therefore propose that il-2 receptor signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of jak1 and jak3 following il-2 -induced heterodimerization of il-2r beta and il-2r gamma .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|23,25 G#protein|26,28 G#protein

nonetheless , a membrane-proximal region of human il-2r beta ( asn240-leu335 ) was critical for jak3 activation , and the amount of jak3 present in activated il-2 receptor complexes increased with time , suggesting that stabilization of jak3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both il-2r beta and il-2r gamma .
3,5 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|26,29 G#protein|37,38 G#protein|41,43 G#protein|46,48 G#protein|49,51 G#protein

moreover , stat5 was found to be the predominant stat transcription factor used by il-2 in human t cells , and specifically required a cooh-terminal region of il-2r beta ( ser386-val525 ) , while stat5 recruitment was not correlated to activation of il-2r gamma or jak3 .

up-regulation of high-affinity dehydroepiandrosterone binding activity by dehydroepiandrosterone in activated human t lymphocytes .
10,13 G#cell_type

although evidence indicates that dehydroepiandrosterone ( dhea ) exerts direct physiological effects , its mechanism of action remains unknown .


dhea binding sites were examined using a whole-cell binding assay in a human t lymphoid cell line , peer , revealing that a single class of high-affinity binding sites for dhea ( dissociation constant = 7.4 +/- 0.53 nmol/l , mean +/- se , n = 4 ) was greatly increased when treated with dhea , phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate , and the ca2+ ionophore a23187 .
12,17 G#cell_line|18,19 G#cell_line

bound [3h] dhea was displaced sensitively by dhea and secondarily by dihydrotestosterone , but not effectively by other steroids , including dhea sulfate .


these results not only indicate the existence of a dhea receptor , but also suggest that t cells become susceptible to regulation by dhea during the process of signal-induced activation .

reconstitution of a cell-free system and identification of the ubiquitin-carrier protein , e2 , and a novel ubiquitin-protein ligase , e3 , involved in conjugation .
9,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

in most cases , the transcriptional factor nf-kappa b is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits , p50 and p65 , which are encoded by two distinct genes of the rel family .
5,7 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|30,32 G#DNA

p50 is translated as a precursor of 105 kda .
0,1 G#protein|7,9 G#protein

the c-terminal domain of the precursor is rapidly degraded , forming the mature p50 subunit consisted of the n-terminal region of the molecule .
1,3 G#protein|12,15 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

the mechanism of generation of p50 is not known .
5,6 G#protein

it has been suggested that the ubiquitin -proteasome system is involved in the process ; however , the specific enzymes involved and the mechanism of limited proteolysis , in which half of the molecule is spared , have been obscure .
6,7 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|19,20 G#protein

palombella and colleagues ( palombella , v.j. , rando , o.j. , goldberg , a.l. , and maniatis , t. ( 1994 ) cell 78 , 773-785 ) have shown that ubiquitin is required for the processing in a cell-free system of a truncated , artificially constructed , 60-kda precursor .
31,32 G#protein|48,50 G#protein

they have also shown that proteasome inhibitors block the processing both in vitro and in vivo .
5,6 G#protein

in this study , we demonstrate reconstitution of a cell-free processing system and demonstrate directly that : ( a ) the ubiquitin -proteasome system is involved in processing of the intact p105 precursor , ( b ) conjugation of ubiquitin to the precursor is an essential intermediate step in the processing , ( c ) the recently discovered novel species of the ubiquitin -carrier protein , e2-f1 , that is involved in the conjugation and degradation of p53 , is also required for the limited processing of the p105 precursor , and ( d ) a novel , approximately 320-kda species of ubiquitin -protein ligase , is involved in the process .
21,22 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|39,40 G#protein|62,63 G#protein|62,65 G#protein|66,67 G#protein|77,78 G#protein|88,90 G#protein|99,101 G#protein|102,103 G#protein|102,105 G#protein|102,105 G#protein

this novel enzyme is distinct from e6-ap , the p53 -conjugating ligase , and from e3 alpha , the " n-end rule " ligase .

flutamide in the treatment of hirsutism : long-term clinical effects , endocrine changes , and androgen receptor behavior .
15,17 G#protein

objective : to investigate the long-term effects of treatment with low doses of flutamide on clinical and hormonal parameters , as well as on the androgen receptor status , in hirsute women .
25,27 G#protein

design : eighteen hirsute patients with regular menses were studied basally and during treatment with 125 mg flutamide , three times per day for 12 months .


barrier or intrauterine contraception was used during the study in sexually active women .


safety parameters were assessed throughout the study .


hirsutism , graded by the modified ferriman-gallwey score , and hormonal parameters were evaluated basally and at 4-month intervals during treatment .


gonadotropin-releasing hormone and acth stimulation tests were performed before and after 3 to 4 months of therapy .


in addition , the concentration of androgen receptors in mononuclear leukocytes was measured , in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle , basally and after 4 months of flutamide treatment .
6,8 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_type

results : flutamide was well tolerated in all women , with the noticeable exception of one patient who presented increased serum transaminase after 8 months of therapy .
20,22 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

hirsutism markedly improved in all women during the treatment ( ferriman-gallwey score after 1 year : 4.1 +/- 0.5 versus 14.1 +/- 0.9 ) .


a reduction of serum androgens was found , whereas no change was observed in either basal or gnrh-stimulated gonadotropins or in the cortisol and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone response to acth .


cycles remained ovulatory .


before treatment , the number of androgen receptors was higher in the luteal than in the follicular phase .
6,8 G#protein

this rhythmic differentiation disappeared after the patients had been given the antiandrogen drug .


conclusions : flutamide is effective in the treatment of hirsutism but requires constant surveillance of liver function .


androgen receptor blockade might be potentiated by a reduction of serum androgens .


flutamide affects androgen receptor behavior during the menstrual cycle .

the meaning of this finding remains to be elucidated .

a pebp2 alpha/aml-1-related factor increases osteocalcin promoter activity through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element .
1,4 G#protein|5,7 G#DNA|13,16 G#DNA

to identify osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors , we initiated an analysis of the promoter of a mouse osteocalcin gene , an osteoblast-specific gene .
2,5 G#DNA|6,8 G#protein|15,16 G#DNA|18,21 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA

in this promoter , we identified two osteoblast-specific cis-acting elements ( ducy , p. and karsenty , g. ( 1995 ) mol.cell.biol.15 , 1858-1869 ) .
7,10 G#DNA

the sequence of one of these elements , ose2 , is identical to the dna-binding site of the pebp2 alpha/aml-1 transcription factors , the mammalian homologues of the drosophila runt protein .
6,7 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|14,16 G#DNA|18,22 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|28,31 G#protein

here we show , using nuclear extracts , recombinant protein , and a specific antiserum against aml-1 proteins in dna-binding assays , that one member of this family , aml-1b , binds specifically to ose2 and is immunologically related to osf2 , the factor present in osteoblast nuclear extracts that binds to ose2 .
8,10 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|34,35 G#DNA|40,41 G#protein|52,53 G#DNA

by dna cotransfection experiments , we also demonstrate that aml-1b can increase the activity of a short osteocalcin promoter through its binding to ose2 .
9,10 G#protein|17,19 G#DNA|23,24 G#DNA

lastly , the different mobilities of osteoblast nuclear extract-dna complexes compared with t-cell nuclear extract-dna complexes , along with the inability of osf2 to be upregulated by retinoic acid , unlike the other pebp2 alpha factors , suggest that osf2 is a new member of this family of transcription factors .
6,10 G#protein|12,16 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|33,36 G#protein|39,40 G#protein|48,50 G#protein

thus , this study demonstrates that aml-1b can increase gene expression of an osteoblast-specific gene through its binding to an osteoblast-specific cis-acting element and presents evidence that osf2 is a member of the pebp2 alpha/aml-1 family of transcription factors .

initiation binding repressor , a factor that binds to the transcription initiation site of the histone h5 gene , is a glycosylated member of a family of cell growth regulators [ corrected ] [ published erratum appears in mol cell biol 1996 feb ; 16 ( 2 ) : 735 ]
0,3 G#protein|10,13 G#DNA|15,17 G#protein|15,18 G#DNA|21,23 G#protein|27,30 G#protein

initiation binding repressor [ corrected ] ( ibr ) is a chicken erythrocyte factor ( apparent molecular mass , 70 to 73 kda ) that binds to the sequences spanning the transcription initiation site of the histone h5 gene , repressing its transcription .
0,3 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|31,34 G#DNA|36,38 G#protein|36,39 G#DNA

a variety of other cells , including transformed erythroid precursors , do not have ibr but a factor referred to as ibf ( 68 to 70 kda ) that recognizes the same ibr sites .
7,10 G#cell_type|14,15 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

we have cloned the ibr cdna and studied the relationship of ibr and ibf .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#DNA|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

ibr is a 503-amino-acid-long acidic protein which is 99.0 % identical to the recently reported human nrf-1/alpha-pal factor and highly related to the invertebrate transcription factors p3a2 and erected wing gene product ( ewg ) .
0,1 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,32 G#protein|33,34 G#protein

we present evidence that ibr and ibf are most likely identical proteins , differing in their degree of glycosylation .
4,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein

we have analyzed several molecular aspects of ibr/f and shown that the factor associates as stable homodimers and that the dimer is the relevant dna-binding species .
7,8 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

the evolutionarily conserved n-terminal half of ibr/f harbors the dna-binding/dimerization domain ( outer limits , 127 to 283 ) , one or several casein kinase ii sites ( 37 to 67 ) , and a bipartite nuclear localization signal ( 89 to 106 ) which appears to be necessary for nuclear targeting .
3,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|23,27 G#protein|35,39 G#protein

binding site selection revealed that the alternating rcgcrygcgy consensus constitutes high-affinity ibr/f binding sites and that the direct-repeat palindrome tgcgcatgcgca is the optimal site .
6,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|11,14 G#DNA|17,19 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA

a survey of genes potentially regulated by this family of factors primarily revealed genes involved in growth-related metabolism .

triggering of the human interleukin-6 gene by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in monocytic cells involves cooperation between interferon regulatory factor-1 , nf kappa b , and sp1 transcription factors .
18,21 G#protein|22,25 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|28,30 G#protein

we investigated the molecular basis of the synergistic induction by interferon-gamma ( ifn-gamma ) / tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf-alpha ) of human interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) gene in thp-1 monocytic cells , and compared it with the basis of this induction by lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) .
10,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|22,28 G#DNA|29,32 G#cell_type

functional studies with il-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the ifn-gamma and/or tnf-alpha action , whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in lps activation .
3,5 G#DNA|14,15 G#protein|16,17 G#protein

the three regions concerned are : 1 ) a region between -73 and -36 , which is the minimal element inducible by lps or tnf-alpha ; 2 ) an element located between -181 and -73 , which appeared to regulate the response to ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha negatively ; and 3 ) a distal element upstream of -224 , which was inducible by ifn-gamma alone .
18,20 G#DNA|24,25 G#protein|43,44 G#protein|45,46 G#protein|52,55 G#DNA|62,63 G#protein

lps signaling was found to involve nf kappa b activation by the p50 /p65 heterodimers .
6,9 G#protein|12,15 G#protein

synergistic induction of the il-6 gene by ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha , in monocytic cells , involved cooperation between the irf-1 and nf kappa b p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the il-6 promoter .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#DNA|7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type|19,20 G#protein|21,24 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|21,26 G#protein|35,38 G#DNA|41,43 G#DNA

this removal occurred by activation of the constitutive sp1 factor , whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by ifn-gamma .

mutation of jak3 in a patient with scid : essential role of jak3 in lymphoid development .
2,3 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

males with x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency ( xscid ) have defects in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain ( gamma c ) gene that encodes a shared , essential component of the receptors of interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) , il-4 , il-7 , il-9 , and il-15 .
14,18 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|14,23 G#DNA|34,35 G#protein|36,37 G#protein|39,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein|43,44 G#protein|46,47 G#protein

the janus family tyrosine kinase jak3 is the only signaling molecule known to be associated with gamma c , so it was hypothesized that defects in jak3 might cause an xscid -like phenotype .
1,5 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

a girl with immunological features indistinguishable from those of xscid was therefore selected for analysis .


an epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) -transformed cell line derived from her lymphocytes had normal gamma c expression but lacked jak3 protein and had greatly diminished jak3 messenger rna .
1,9 G#cell_line|12,13 G#cell_type|15,17 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|26,29 G#RNA

sequencing revealed a different mutation on each allele : a single nucleotide insertion resulting in a frame shift and premature termination in the jak3 jh4 domain and a nonsense mutation in the jak3 jh2 domain .
23,24 G#protein|23,26 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

the lack of jak3 expression correlated with impaired b cell signaling , as demonstrated by the inability of il-4 to activate stat6 in the ebv -transformed cell line from the patient . these observations indicate that the functions of gamma c are dependent on jak3 and that jak3 is essential for lymphoid development and signaling .

constitutive overexpression of the l-selectin gene in fresh leukemic cells of adult t-cell leukemia that can be transactivated by human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 tax .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_type|19,26 G#protein

l-selectin is an adhesion molecule of the selectin family that mediates the initial step of leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium .
0,1 G#protein

upon cellular activation , expression of the l-selectin gene is downregulated at both the protein and mrna levels .
7,8 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA

to understand the mechanism of leukemic cell infiltration into organs , we studied the expression and regulation of l-selectin mrna in fresh leukemic cells of adult t-cell leukemia ( atl ) patients and investigated the response of the l-selectin promoter to human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 ( htlv-1 ) tax , which is a viral transcriptional transactivator .
5,7 G#cell_type|18,19 G#protein|18,20 G#RNA|22,24 G#cell_type|38,39 G#protein|38,40 G#DNA|41,51 G#protein|55,58 G#protein

flow cytometry showed that l-selectin was expressed on fresh atl cells along with other activation antigens .
4,5 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_line|14,16 G#protein

northern blot analysis showed that atl cells overexpressed that l-selectin mrna and that the level was aberrantly upregulated after pma stimulation .
5,7 G#cell_line|9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#RNA

studies using in situ hybridization showed expression of the l-selectin mrna in the infiltrating leukemic cells in the liver of two atl patients .
9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#RNA|14,16 G#cell_type

intravenous injection of a rat t-cell line that overexpresses l-selectin showed increased organ infiltration .
4,7 G#cell_line|9,10 G#protein

the induction of tax expression in jpx9 cells resulted in about a twofold increase in the mrna expression levels compared with the basal level .
3,4 G#protein|6,8 G#cell_line|16,17 G#RNA

chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( cat ) assay after transient cotransfection showed about a fivefold transactivation of the l-selectin promoter by tax .
0,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein|16,18 G#DNA|19,20 G#protein

the serum level of the shed form of l-selectin was significantly increased in atl patients ( mean +/- sd , 4,215.4 +/- 4,111 ng/ml ) compared with those of asymptomatic carriers and healthy blood donors ( mean +/- sd , 1,148.0 +/- 269.0 ng/ml and 991.9 +/- 224 ng/ml , respectively ) .
8,9 G#protein

these results indicated that atl cells constitutively overexpress the l-selectin gene that can be transactivated by htlv-1 tax .

the overexpression of l-selectin , as well as of inflammatory cytokines , by atl cells may provide a basis for atl cells to attach the vascular endothelium , leading to transmigration and organ infitration .

human herpesvirus 6 variant a , but not variant b , infects ebv -positive b lymphoid cells , activating the latent ebv genome through a bzlf-1 -dependent mechanism .
12,17 G#cell_line|20,23 G#DNA|25,26 G#protein

human herpesvirus 6 , a predominantly t lymphotropic virus , has been recently shown to infect some ebv -positive b cell lines , and to induce in them the activation of the ebv lytic cycle .
17,22 G#cell_line

here we have confirmed and extended such observations , showing that ( 1 ) this phenomenon is restricted to the variant a of hhv-6 : in fact two isolates belonging to the hhv-6 variant b ( ba92 and z29 ) were neither able to infect any b cell line , independently of the ebv status , nor to induce the ebv genome expression .
46,49 G#cell_line

the only exception is represented by the p3hr1 cells , in which , however , the infection by the variant b does not determine induction of ebv antigens ; ( 2 ) the presence of the ebv genome contributes to the susceptibility of the b cell lines to hhv-6 infection , increasing the binding sites and the percentage of infectable cells , as detected by immunoelectron microscopy ; and ( 3 ) hhv-6 infected t cells , transfected with plasmids bearing the promoter regions of the ebv early genes bzlf1 and bmrf1 , show a strong transactivation of these promoters .

evidence for normal vitamin d receptor messenger ribonucleic acid and genotype in absorptive hypercalciuria .
3,6 G#protein|3,9 G#RNA

absorptive hypercalciuria ( a stone-forming condition ) is characterized by gut hyperabsorption of calcium , hypercalciuria , and reduced bone density .


inasmuch as these features implicate enhanced calcitriol action in gut and bone , we analyzed the vitamin d receptor ( vdr ) gene to ascertain whether an abnormality of this gene marks patients with intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium .
16,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|16,23 G#DNA

we have compared the frequency of a restriction fragment length polymorphism ( bsm i ) associated with different alleles of the vdr gene in a group of 33 well characterized absorptive hypercalciuric patients and a group of 36 normal race- and age-matched control subjects .
7,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|21,22 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

there was no difference between the distribution of the vdr alleles in the patient population when compared with the normal population .
9,10 G#protein

the coding region of vdr messenger rna was also normal , as determined by both dna sequence analysis and chemical mismatch cleavage analysis of copy dna from 11 index absorptive hypercalciuric patients .
4,5 G#protein|4,7 G#RNA|15,17 G#DNA

on the basis of these results , we propose that the enhanced intestinal calcium absorption invariably seen in absorptive hypercalciuria and attendant symptoms of this disorder are not attributable to mutations of the vdr and are not linked to a common vdr genotype .

transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the human c-type lectin leukocyte receptor aim/cd69 and functional characterization of its tumor necrosis factor-alpha -responsive elements .
7,12 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|18,21 G#protein|22,23 G#DNA|18,23 G#DNA

the human activation antigen cd69 is a member of the c-type animal lectin superfamily that functions as a signal-transmitting receptor .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|10,14 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

although the expression of cd69 can be induced in vitro on cells of most hematopoietic lineages with a wide variety of stimuli , in vivo it is mainly expressed by t- lymphocytes located in the inflammatory infiltrates of several human diseases .
4,5 G#protein|31,32 G#cell_type|30,32 G#cell_type

to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the constitutive and inducible expression of cd69 by leukocytes , we isolated the promoter region of the cd69 gene and carried out its functional characterization .
12,13 G#protein|14,15 G#cell_type|19,21 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein

sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the cd69 gene revealed the presence of a potential tata element 30 base pairs upstream of the major transcription initiation site and several putative binding sequences for inducible transcription factors ( nf-kappa b , egr-1 , ap-1 ) , which might mediate the inducible expression of this gene .
4,6 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|18,22 G#DNA|25,28 G#DNA|35,37 G#protein|38,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein|43,44 G#protein

transient expression of cd69 promoter-based reporter gene constructs in k562 cells indicated that the proximal promoter region spanning positions -78 to +16 contained the cis-acting sequences necessary for basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate -inducible transcription of the cd69 gene .
3,4 G#protein|3,8 G#DNA|9,11 G#cell_line|15,17 G#DNA|14,17 G#DNA|24,26 G#DNA|37,38 G#protein|37,39 G#DNA

removal of the upstream sequences located between positions -78 and -38 resulted in decreased promoter strength and abolished the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate .


we also found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf-alpha ) is capable of inducing the surface expression of the cd69 molecule as well as the promoter activity of fusion plasmids that contain 5'-flanking sequences of the cd69 gene , suggesting that this cytokine may regulate in vivo the expression of cd69 .

characterization of 5' end of human thromboxane receptor gene .
5,9 G#DNA|2,9 G#DNA

organizational analysis and mapping of protein kinase c -- responsive elements regulating expression in platelets .
10,11 G#DNA|5,11 G#DNA|14,15 G#cell_type

platelet thromboxane receptors are acutely and reversibly upregulated after acute myocardial infarction .
0,1 G#cell_type|0,3 G#protein

to determine if platelet thromboxane receptors are under transcriptional control , we isolated and characterized human genomic dna clones containing the 5' flanking region of the thromboxane receptor gene .
4,6 G#protein|15,19 G#DNA|21,24 G#DNA|26,29 G#DNA

the exon-intron structure of the 5' portion of the thromboxane receptor gene was determined initially by comparing the nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking genomic clone with that of a novel human uterine thromboxane receptor cdna that extended the mrna 141 bp further upstream than the previously identified human placental cdna .
1,3 G#DNA|5,7 G#DNA|9,11 G#protein|9,12 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA|22,26 G#DNA|33,35 G#protein|30,36 G#DNA|39,40 G#RNA|40,44 G#DNA|46,51 G#DNA

a major transcription initiation site was located in three human tissues approximately 560 bp upstream from the translation initiation codon and 380 bp upstream from any previously identified transcription initiation site .
2,5 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA|17,20 G#DNA|21,24 G#DNA|28,31 G#DNA

the thromboxane receptor gene has neither a tata nor a caat consensus site .
1,3 G#protein|1,4 G#DNA|7,8 G#DNA|10,13 G#DNA

promoter function of the 5' flanking region of the thromboxane receptor gene was evaluated by transfection of thromboxane receptor gene promoter/ chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( cat ) chimera plasmids into platelet-like k562 cells .
4,7 G#DNA|9,11 G#protein|9,12 G#DNA|17,19 G#protein|17,20 G#DNA|21,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|17,28 G#DNA|30,32 G#cell_line

thromboxane receptor promoter activity , as assessed by cat expression , was relatively weak but was significantly enhanced by phorbol ester treatment .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein

functional analysis of 5' deletion constructs in transfected k562 cells and gel mobility shift localized the major phorbol ester -responsive motifs in the thromboxane receptor gene promoter to a cluster of activator protein-2 ( ap-2 ) binding consensus sites located approximately 1.8 kb 5' from the transcription initiation site .
3,6 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_line|23,25 G#protein|23,26 G#DNA|31,33 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|31,39 G#DNA|46,49 G#DNA

these studies are the first to determine the structure and organization of the 5' end of the thromboxane receptor gene and demonstrate that thromboxane receptor gene expression can be regulated by activation of protein kinase c via induction of an ap-2 -like nuclear factor binding to upstream promoter elements .
17,19 G#protein|17,20 G#DNA|23,25 G#protein|23,26 G#DNA|33,36 G#protein|40,41 G#protein|40,44 G#protein|46,49 G#DNA

these findings strongly suggest that the mechanism for previously described upregulation of platelet thromboxane receptors after acute myocardial infarction is increased thromboxane receptor gene transcription in platelet-progenitor cells .

estrogen receptor concentration and social factors as predictors of natural killer cell activity in early-stage breast cancer patients .
0,2 G#protein

confirmation of a model .


previous work of ours has demonstrated that a significant amount of natural killer ( nk ) activity variance after surgery in stage i and ii breast cancer patients could be accounted for by both the estrogen receptor ( er ) status of the tumor and by social factors , namely , perceived social support and seeking social support as a general coping strategy .
35,37 G#protein|38,39 G#protein

as considerable evidence has accumulated that social support in both animal and human populations may have survival value , we sought to test the reliability of this regression model , using coping and perceived support factor values obtained at 3 months after surgery to account for concurrent follow-up nk activity in this serially assessed group of patients .


it was found that the most significant variable predicting nk activity at follow-up was tumor er concentration , with higher nk activity associated with er - status .
15,16 G#protein|24,25 G#protein

in addition , seeking social support as a coping strategy , as well as the perceived quality of support , also entered the model to account for a significant amount of nk activity variance ( multivariate f = 5.25 , p less than 0.001 ) .


if , as the literature suggests , nk activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since er - tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by nk cells because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of effector cells to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action .
18,19 G#protein|38,40 G#cell_type|50,52 G#cell_type

the finding related to social support also replicates results from an independent sample of breast cancer patients .


this finding , taken together with other evidence that this social variable is associated with longer survival in breast cancer populations , underscores the potential importance of this social support variable .


our findings also suggest one possible immunological variable involved , with potential clinical significance , for this patient population .


solution structure of the sequence-specific hmg box of the lymphocyte transcriptional activator sox-4 .
4,7 G#DNA|9,12 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

two groups of hmg box proteins are distinguished .
3,6 G#protein

proteins in the first group contain multiple hmg boxes , are non-sequence-specific , and recognize structural features as found in cruciform dna and cross-over dna .
7,9 G#protein|20,22 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA

the abundant chromosomal protein hmg-1 belongs to this subgroup .
2,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein

proteins in the second group carry a single hmg box with affinity for the minor groove of the heptamer motif aacaaag or variations thereof .
7,10 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA

a solution structure for the non-sequence-specific c-terminal hmg box of hmg-1 has recently been proposed .
6,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein

now , we report the solution structure of the sequence-specific hmg-box of the sry-related protein sox-4 .
9,11 G#protein|13,15 G#protein|15,16 G#protein

nmr analysis demonstrated the presence of three alpha-helices ( val10-gln22 , glu30-leu41 and phe50-tyr65 ) connected by loop regions ( ser23-ala49 and leu42-pro49 ) .
7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

helices i and ii are positioned in an antiparallel mode and form one arm of the hmg box .
0,4 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|16,18 G#protein

helix iii is less rigid , makes an average angle of about 90 degrees with helices i and ii , and constitutes the other arm of the molecule .
0,2 G#protein|15,19 G#protein

as in hmg1b , the overall structure of the sox-4 hmg box is l-shaped and is maintained by a cluster of conserved , mainly aromatic residues .

nuclear factor-il6 activates the human il-4 promoter in t cells .
0,2 G#protein|4,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_type

positive regulatory element i ( pre-i ) is a strong enhancer element essential for expression of the human il-4 gene .
0,4 G#DNA|5,6 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|17,20 G#DNA

to identify transcription factors binding to pre-i , we screened a cdna expression library from jurkat t cells and isolated a cdna encoding nuclear factor ( nf ) -il6 ( also known as c/ebp beta ) .
2,4 G#protein|6,7 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA|16,18 G#cell_type|15,18 G#cell_line|21,22 G#DNA|23,25 G#protein|25,29 G#protein|33,35 G#protein

nf-il6 mrna was found in human jurkat t cells and in the mouse th2 clone d10 , but not in th1 clone 29 .
0,2 G#RNA|7,9 G#cell_type|5,9 G#cell_line|12,15 G#cell_line|15,16 G#cell_line|20,23 G#cell_line

rnf-il6 expressed in bacteria was shown to specifically bind to pre-i .
0,1 G#protein|10,11 G#DNA

pre-i forms multiple dna-protein complexes with nuclear extracts from jurkat cells .
0,1 G#DNA|2,5 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_line

some of these complexes were demonstrated to contain nf-il6 by using anti- c/ebp beta abs .
8,9 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|11,15 G#protein

overexpression of nf-il6 enhanced expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene linked to the pre-i -thymidine kinase or the human il-4 promoter more than 10-fold in jurkat cells .
2,3 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|7,12 G#DNA|15,16 G#DNA|15,18 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|20,23 G#DNA|27,29 G#cell_line

promoter deletion studies revealed two additional nf-il6 binding sites located at positions -44 to -36 ( c/ebp proximal ) and -87 to -79 ( c/ebp medial ) , respectively .
6,7 G#protein|6,9 G#DNA|16,18 G#protein|24,26 G#protein

our results demonstrate that nf-il6 is involved in transcriptional activation of the human il-4 promoter in t cells .

identification of an i kappa b alpha-associated protein kinase in a human monocytic cell line and determination of its phosphorylation sites on i kappa b alpha .
3,9 G#protein|11,15 G#cell_line|19,21 G#protein|22,26 G#protein

nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-kappa b ) is stored in the cytoplasm as an inactive form through interaction with i kappa b .
0,4 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|20,23 G#protein

stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of i kappa b alpha , which is presumed to be important for the subsequent degradation .
9,12 G#protein|9,13 G#protein

we have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) -dependent cell-free activation system of nf-kappa b in association with the induction of i kappa b alpha phosphorylation .
17,19 G#protein|25,28 G#protein|25,29 G#protein

in this study , we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the lps -stimulated human monocytic cell line , thp-1 , that specifically binds and phosphorylates i kappa b alpha .
8,9 G#protein|14,20 G#cell_line|21,22 G#cell_line|28,32 G#protein

lps stimulation transiently enhanced the i kappa b alpha -bound kinase activity in thp-1 cells .
5,8 G#protein|5,9 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_line

mutational analyses of i kappa b alpha and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as ser and thr residues in the c-terminal acidic domain of i kappa b alpha .
3,6 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|29,32 G#protein|33,36 G#protein|33,37 G#protein

moreover , we show that the peptide , corresponding to the c-terminal acidic domain of i kappa b alpha , blocked the lps -induced nf-kappa b activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous i kappa b alpha in a cell-free system using thp-1 cells .
11,14 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|15,19 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|34,37 G#protein|34,38 G#protein|43,45 G#cell_line

these results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of lps by inducing the phosphorylation of the c-terminal region of i kappa b alpha and subsequent dissociation of the nf-kappa b . i kappa b alpha complex .

bik , a novel death-inducing protein shares a distinct sequence motif with bcl-2 family proteins and interacts with viral and cellular survival-promoting proteins .
0,1 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|12,15 G#protein|20,23 G#protein

the survival-promoting activity of the bcl-2 family of proteins appears to be modulated by interactions between various cellular proteins .
5,7 G#protein|17,19 G#protein

we have identified a novel cellular protein , bik , that interacts with the cellular survival-promoting proteins , bcl-2 and bcl-xl , as well as the viral survival-promoting proteins , epstein barr virus -bhrf1 and adenovirus e1b-19 kda .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|26,29 G#protein|30,34 G#protein|35,38 G#protein

in transient transfection assays , bik promotes cell death in a manner similar to the death-promoting members of the bcl-2 family , bax and bak .
5,6 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein

this death-promoting activity of bik can be suppressed by coexpression of bcl-2 , bcl-xl , ebv-bhrf1 and e1b-19 kda proteins suggesting that bik may be a common target for both cellular and viral anti-apoptotic proteins .
4,5 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|30,35 G#protein

while bik does not show overt homology to the bh1 and bh2 conserved domains characteristic of the bcl-2 family , it does share a 9 amino acid domain ( bh3 ) with bax and bak which may be a critical determinant for the death-promoting activity of these proteins .

the human tcf-1 gene encodes a nuclear dna-binding protein uniquely expressed in normal and neoplastic t-lineage lymphocytes .
1,4 G#DNA|6,9 G#protein|12,17 G#cell_line

the tcf-1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor with affinity for a sequence motif occurring in a number of t-cell enhancers .
1,2 G#protein|1,3 G#DNA|5,8 G#protein|12,14 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA

tcf-1 mrna was originally found to be expressed in a t cell-specific fashion within a set of human and mouse cell lines .
0,1 G#protein|0,2 G#RNA|17,18 G#cell_line|19,22 G#cell_line|17,22 G#cell_line

in contrast , expression reportedly occurs in multiple nonlymphoid tissues during murine embryogenesis .


we have now raised a monoclonal antibody to document expression and biochemistry of the human tcf-1 protein .
5,7 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|14,17 G#protein

as expected , the tcf-1 protein was detectable only in cell lines of t lineage .
4,6 G#protein|10,15 G#cell_line

its expression was always restricted to the nucleus .


immunohistochemistry on a panel of human tissues revealed that the tcf-1 protein was found exclusively in thymocytes and in cd3+ t cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues .
10,11 G#protein|10,12 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type|19,22 G#cell_line

western blotting yielded a set of bands ranging from 25 kd to 55 kd , resulting from extensive alternative splicing .


the tcf-1 protein was detectable in all samples of a set of 22 t-cell malignancies of various stages of maturation , but was absent from a large number of other hematologic neoplasms .
1,2 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_type|30,32 G#cell_type

these observations imply a t cell-specific function for tcf-1 , a notion corroborated by recent observations on tcf-1 knock-out mice .
8,9 G#protein

in addition , these results indicate that nuclear tcf-1 expression can serve as a pan-t-lineage marker in the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies .

cross-linking of fc gamma receptors activates hiv-1 long terminal repeat -driven transcription in human monocytes .
2,5 G#protein|6,10 G#DNA|13,15 G#cell_type

elevation of the levels of circulating immune complexes frequently accompanies hiv-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to aids .
5,8 G#protein

here we report that cross-linking of fc gamma ri or fc gamma rii by adherent human igg or by specific anti-fc gamma r mab activates hiv-1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line bf24 and increased hiv rna expression in monocytes from hiv infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-pcr .
6,9 G#protein|10,13 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|20,24 G#protein|30,34 G#cell_line|34,35 G#cell_line|37,39 G#RNA|41,42 G#cell_type

in thp-1 cells , fc gamma r cross-linking induced nf-kappa b , which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat ( ltr ) of hiv-1 and to activate hiv-1 transcription . anti-tnf-alpha antibody but not anti-il-1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of hiv-1 - ltr -driven transcription and the induction of nf-kappa b by fc gamma r cross-linking .
1,2 G#cell_line|1,3 G#cell_line|4,7 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|19,21 G#DNA|23,26 G#DNA|27,28 G#DNA|37,39 G#protein|41,44 G#protein|52,53 G#DNA|59,61 G#protein|62,65 G#protein

these results indicate that fc gamma r can mediate a tnf-alpha -dependent induction of hiv-1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of hiv-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes .

signalling via cd28 of human naive neonatal t lymphocytes .
2,3 G#protein|4,9 G#cell_line

accessory molecules play a crucial role in the development of the t cell response to antigenic challenge .


we have examined the role of cd28 in modulating the ' naive ' neonatal t cell response to anti-cd2 -mediated activation .
6,7 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

to compare the role of cd28 , neonatal and adult t cells were stimulated with a pair of mitogenic anti-cd2 antibodies in the presence or absence of anti- cd28 moab .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#cell_type|10,12 G#cell_type|9,12 G#cell_type|18,21 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|27,30 G#protein

with anti-cd2 alone , neonatal t cells proliferated slightly but produced no detectable il-2 , whereas adult t cells proliferated vigorously , with significant il-2 production .
1,2 G#protein|4,7 G#cell_type|13,14 G#protein|17,19 G#cell_type|24,25 G#protein

costimulation with anti- cd28 moab greatly enhanced the proliferative response of neonatal t cells to levels equivalent to those of adult t cells , whereas adult t cells showed only slight increases .
3,4 G#protein|2,5 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type|11,14 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_type|20,23 G#cell_type|26,28 G#cell_type|25,28 G#cell_type

although il-2 secretion was increased in the presence of anti- cd28 moab , neonatal t cell il-2 production remained lower than in adults .
1,2 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|13,16 G#cell_type|16,17 G#protein

in contrast , enhancement of il-2 mrna expression in neonates was similar to adult levels .
5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#RNA

anti- cd28 moab costimulation increased nf kappa b levels in neonates , albeit to levels lower than that of adults .
1,2 G#protein|1,3 G#protein|5,8 G#protein

the cellular mechanism governing the diminished proliferative response of neonatal t lymphocytes to anti-cd2 may therefore be due to decreased nf kappa b induction , reduced il-2 mrna expression and deficient il-2 production .
9,12 G#cell_type|13,14 G#protein|20,23 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|26,28 G#RNA|31,32 G#protein

although anti- cd28 moab costimulation enhances all of the above signals , nf kappa b and il-2 levels remain lower than in adults , suggesting the need for further activation requirements in the neonate .

the tcl1 oncogene on human chromosome 14q32.1 is involved in chromosome translocations [ t(14;14)(q11;q32.1) and t(7;14)(q35;q32.1) ] and inversions [ inv14(q11;q32.1) ] with tcr alpha/beta loci in t-cell leukemias , such as t-prolymphocytic ( t-pll ) .

we have analyzed the expression of tcl1 mrna and protein in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( pbls ) from four at cases and from healthy controls .
6,8 G#RNA|9,10 G#protein|11,14 G#cell_type|15,16 G#cell_type

we found that the tcl1 gene was overexpressed in the pbls of an at patient with a large clonal t-cell population exhibiting the t(14;14) translocation but not in the lymphocytes of the other cases .
4,6 G#DNA|10,11 G#cell_type|17,21 G#cell_line|29,30 G#cell_type

fluorescence in situ hybridization of the tcl1 genomic locus to lymphocyte metaphases from the at patient with the t-cell clonal expansion showed that the breakpoint of the t(14;14) translocation lies within the tcl1 locus and is accompanied by an inverted duplication of the distal part of chromosome 14 .
6,9 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA|39,41 G#DNA|43,45 G#DNA|46,48 G#DNA

these data indicate that tcl1 is activated in preleukemic clonal cells as a consequence of chromosome translocation involving sequences from the tcr locus at 14q11 .
4,5 G#DNA|8,11 G#cell_line|21,23 G#DNA|24,25 G#DNA

deregulation of tcl1 is the first event in the initiation of malignancy in these types of leukemias and represents a potential tool for clinical evaluation .

c/ebp proteins activate transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in macrophages/ monocytes .
0,2 G#protein|6,14 G#DNA|16,17 G#cell_type

three binding sites for c/ebp proteins are found in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) long terminal repeat ( ltr ) ( v.m. tesmer , a.rajadhyaksha , j.babin , and m.bina , proc.natl.acad.sci. usa 90 : 7298-7302 , 1993 ) .
4,6 G#protein|10,21 G#DNA|22,23 G#DNA

we have determined the functional role of c/ebp proteins and c/ebp sites in regulating transcription from the hiv- 1 ltr in monocytes /macrophages .
7,9 G#protein|10,12 G#DNA|18,19 G#DNA|17,19 G#DNA|20,21 G#cell_type|20,22 G#cell_type

inhibition of endogenous c/ebp proteins , using either an excess of c/ebp binding sites or a trans- dominant negative inhibitor , demonstrated that c/ebp proteins are required for basal and activated levels of hiv-1 ltr transcription in the promonocytic cell line u937 .
3,5 G#protein|2,5 G#protein|11,14 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|22,24 G#protein|33,34 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA|37,41 G#cell_line

northern ( rna ) blots and binding assays showed that nf-il6 is the only known c/ebp family member which is increased when u937 cells are activated .
10,11 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|22,24 G#cell_line

mutational analyses of the hiv-1 ltr showed that one c/ebp site is required for normal ltr transcription both before and after cellular activation and that the two 3' c/ebp sites are functionally equivalent .
5,6 G#DNA|4,6 G#DNA|9,11 G#DNA|15,16 G#DNA|28,30 G#DNA

however , transcription from crippled hiv-1 ltrs lacking c/ebp sites can still be induced following activation of u937 cells .
6,7 G#DNA|4,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#DNA|17,19 G#cell_line

several models are suggested for how elevated nf-il6 may participate in an autostimulatory loop involving hiv infection , macrophage activation , cytokine expression , and hiv replication .

human immunodeficiency virus type-2 gene expression : two enhancers and their activation by t-cell activators .
8,9 G#DNA|13,14 G#cell_type

the human immunodeficiency viruses ( hivs ) may include a spectrum of retroviruses with varying potential to infect their host , undergo long periods of latent infection , and induce pathology .


since expression of the viruses is in large part regulated by the sequence elements in their long terminal repeats ( ltrs ) , this study was directed to an analysis of the regulatory elements in the hiv-2 ltr .
12,14 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|20,21 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA|36,38 G#DNA

the hiv-2 ltr was found to contain two enhancers .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA

one of these enhancers is , in part , identical to the hiv-1 enhancer .
3,4 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA

this enhancer in hiv-1 is the t-cell activation response element ; in hiv-2 , however , it is the second enhancer that is mainly responsible for activation in response to t-cell activators .
1,2 G#DNA|6,10 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA

the second enhancer interacts with two nuclear binding proteins ( 85 kd and 27 kd mobility ) that appear to be required for optimal enhancer function and activation .
2,3 G#DNA|6,9 G#protein

observations such as these encourage the speculation that there may be subtle differences in the regulation of hiv-1 and hiv-2 expression that may be relevant to the possible longer latency and reduced pathogenicity of hiv-2 .


nf-m ( chicken c/ebp beta ) induces eosinophilic differentiation and apoptosis in a hematopoietic progenitor cell line .
0,1 G#protein|2,5 G#protein|13,17 G#cell_line

caat/enhancer binding proteins ( c/ebps ) are transcriptional activators implicated in the differentiation processes of various cell lineages .
0,1 G#DNA|0,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein

we have shown earlier that nf-m , the chicken homolog of c/ebp beta , is specifically expressed in myelomonocytic and eosinophilic cells of the hematopoietic system .
5,6 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|18,22 G#cell_type

to investigate the role of nf-m in hematopoietic cell lineage commitment , we constructed a conditional form of the protein by fusing it to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor .
5,6 G#protein|7,10 G#cell_line|25,28 G#protein|30,33 G#protein

this construct was stably expressed in a multipotent progenitor cell line transformed by the myb-ets oncoprotein .
7,11 G#cell_line|14,16 G#protein

we report here that both nf-m -dependent promoter constructs and resident genes could be activated by addition of beta-estradiol to the nf-m -estrogen receptor expressing progenitors .
5,6 G#protein|5,9 G#DNA|21,22 G#protein|21,24 G#protein|21,26 G#cell_line

at the same time , we observed a down-regulation of progenitor-specific surface markers and the up-regulation of differentiation markers restricted to the eosinophil and myeloid lineages .
10,13 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|22,23 G#cell_type|24,26 G#cell_type

in addition to the onset of differentiation , cell death was induced with typical apoptotic features .


our results suggest that nf-m plays an important role in commitment along the eosinophil lineage and in the induction of apoptosis .

prolactin and interleukin-2 receptors in t lymphocytes signal through a mgf-stat5-like transcription factor .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|2,4 G#protein|5,7 G#cell_type|10,13 G#protein

the cell surface receptors for prl and interleukin-2 ( il-2 ) are structurally distinct , but share regulatory tasks in t lymphocytes .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

they can stimulate proliferation and activate transcription of over-lapping sets of genes of t cells .
13,15 G#cell_type

prl and il-2 receptor activation are both linked to the jak/stat ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|12,18 G#protein

we investigated the ability of prl and il-2 to activate stat proteins in different t cell lines .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|10,12 G#protein|14,17 G#cell_line

the dna binding specificities , the reactivities toward stat-specific antisera , and the mol wt of il-2 - and prl -induced dna-binding proteins in nb2 and c196 t cell lines were investigated .
16,17 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|19,23 G#protein|24,30 G#cell_line

a comparison with the stat proteins induced by interferon-gamma , prl , and il-6 in t47d mammary tumor cells was made .
4,6 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|15,19 G#cell_line

we found that these parameters were indistinguishable for one of the prl- and il-2- induced factors .
11,16 G#protein

a transcription factor closely related to mammary gland factor-stat5 is rapidly activated upon interaction of il-2 and prl with their respective receptors .
6,9 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

activation of a second protein related to stat1 was also observed .
7,8 G#protein

our results emphasize the role of prl as a regulator of the immune response and indicate that the stat factors mammary gland factor-stat5 and stat1 play a role in the regulation of gene expression during t cell development .

ets1 transactivates the human gm-csf promoter in jurkat t cells stimulated with pma and ionomycin .
0,1 G#protein|3,6 G#DNA|7,10 G#cell_line

activation of t helper cells results in coordinate expression of a number of cytokines involved in differentiation , proliferation and activation of the haematopoietic system .
2,5 G#cell_type|13,14 G#protein

granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) is one such cytokine whose increased expression results partly from increases in transcription .
0,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

cis-acting elements with nf kappa b , ap-1 and ets-like motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the gm-csf gene , which are important for transcriptional activity following pma and ionomycin stimulation .
0,2 G#DNA|3,6 G#DNA|3,6 G#protein|7,8 G#DNA|7,8 G#protein|9,11 G#DNA|20,21 G#protein|20,22 G#DNA

a number of the ets family of transcription factors are expressed in t cells , including ets1 and elf1 .
4,6 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type|16,17 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

here we describe the ability of these factors to interact with a site ( gm5 ) , located within the cle0 element , -47 to -40 upstream of the gm-csf transcription initiation site .
14,15 G#DNA|20,22 G#DNA|23,27 G#DNA|29,30 G#protein|29,33 G#DNA

exogenous ets1 , but not elf1 , can transactivate gm-csf , through the gm5 site , in a pma / ionomycin dependent manner .
1,2 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|13,14 G#DNA

other unidentified ets-like factors present in jurkat cells are also capable of binding gm5 .
2,4 G#protein|6,8 G#cell_line|13,14 G#DNA

mutation of the core ets binding site from -ggaa- to -ggat- prevents the binding of ets-like factors with the exception of ets1 .
4,7 G#DNA|8,11 G#DNA|15,17 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

the gm-csf promoter , modified in this way to be ets1 specific , is fully responsive to pma / ionomycin induction , in addition to ets1 transactivation in the presence of pma and ionomycin .
1,2 G#protein|1,3 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

together these data suggest that ets1 may be involved in mediating the increased gm-csf production associated with t cell activation .

quantitation of beta 1 triiodothyronine receptor mrna in human tissues by competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction .
2,6 G#protein|2,7 G#RNA

thyroid hormones act by binding to nuclear receptor proteins , the thyroid hormone receptors ( tr ) alpha and beta .
6,9 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|11,20 G#protein

data from cell culture and animal studies indicate that tr expression may be regulated to modulate target organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone .
9,10 G#protein

to investigate whether such adaptive changes in tr expression occur in humans , we determined the mrna levels of the htr beta 1 in various thyroid states .
7,8 G#protein|20,23 G#protein

patients with overt hypo - or hyper thyroidism were enrolled in the study .


total rna was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and htr beta 1 mrna levels determined by quantitative competitive reverse transcription pcr .
0,2 G#RNA|5,9 G#cell_type|10,13 G#protein|10,14 G#RNA

for comparison , htr beta 1 mrna levels were determined in lymphocytes and normal thyroid tissue of euthyroid patients .
3,6 G#protein|3,7 G#RNA|11,12 G#cell_type

human tr beta 1 mrna levels in lymphocytes were 1.8 +/- 0.4 , 1.9 +/- 0.5 , 1.1 +/- 0.4 10 ( -18 ) mol/microgram rna in hypo - , eu - and hyper thyroid patients , respectively , corresponding to an estimated 0.5 -2 molecules per cell .
0,4 G#protein|0,5 G#RNA|7,8 G#cell_type

although the mean htr beta 1 mrna levels were 40 % lower in hyperthyroid than in euthyroid subjects , this difference did not reach statistical significance .
3,6 G#protein|3,7 G#RNA

similar levels of htr beta 1 mrna levels were detected in thyroid gland from euthyroid patients .
3,6 G#protein|3,7 G#RNA

in summary , we developed an assay for the quantitative determination of htr beta 1 mrna levels in small human tissue samples , containing as little as 50 ng of total rna .
12,15 G#protein|12,16 G#RNA

absolute htr beta 1 mrna levels are very low with an estimated one molecule of mrna being present in a mononuclear blood cell or thyrocyte .
1,4 G#protein|1,5 G#RNA|15,16 G#RNA|20,23 G#cell_type|24,25 G#cell_type

no up-regulation of htr beta 1 was seen in hypothyroid relative to euthyroid patients .
3,6 G#protein

however , there is a non-significant trend towards a down-regulation of htr beta 1 mrna levels in hyperthyroid patients .
11,14 G#protein|11,15 G#RNA

multiple proteins interact with the nuclear inhibitory protein repressor element in the human interleukin-3 promoter .
1,2 G#protein|5,10 G#DNA|12,15 G#DNA

t cell expression of interleukin 3 ( il-3 ) is directed by positive and negative cis-acting dna elements clustered within 300 base pairs of the transcriptional start site .
4,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|12,18 G#DNA|25,28 G#DNA

a strong repressor element , termed nuclear inhibitory protein ( nip ) , was previously mapped to a segment of the il-3 promoter between nucleotides -271 and -250 .
2,4 G#protein|6,9 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA

functional characterization of this element demonstrates that it can mediate repression when linked in cis to a heterologous promoter .
17,19 G#DNA

dna binding experiments were carried out to characterize the repressor activity .


using varying conditions , three distinct complexes were shown to interact specifically with the nip region , although only one correlates with repressor activity .
14,15 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA

complex 1 results from binding of a ubiquitous polypeptide that recognizes the 3' portion of this sequence and is not required for repression .
0,2 G#protein|12,14 G#DNA

complex 2 corresponds to binding of transcription factor ( upstream stimulatory factor ) to an e-box motif in the 5' portion of the nip region .
0,2 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|15,17 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein|23,25 G#DNA

dna binding specificity of complex 3 overlaps with that of upstream stimulatory factor but is clearly distinct .
10,13 G#protein

to determine which of the latter two complexes represents nip activity , we incorporated small alterations into the nip site of an il-3 promoter -linked reporter construct and examined their effects on nip -mediated repression .
9,10 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|18,20 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA|22,27 G#DNA|32,33 G#protein

functional specificity for repression matches the dna binding specificity of complex 3 ; both repressor activity and complex 3 binding require the consensus sequence ctcacntnc .
10,12 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|22,24 G#DNA

the hematopoietic transcription factor pu.1 is downregulated in human multiple myeloma cell lines .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|8,13 G#cell_line

pu.1 is a hematopoietic transcription factor belonging to the ets-family .
0,1 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|9,10 G#protein

it is identical to the spi-1 oncogene , which is implicated in spleen focus-forming virus-induced murine erythroleukemias .
5,7 G#DNA

pu.1 seems to be required for early development of multiple hematopoietic lineages , but its expression in mature cells is preferentially observed in cells of the b-cell-and monocyte/macrophage- differentiation lineage .
0,1 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_type|17,19 G#cell_type|26,30 G#cell_type

it binds the so-called pu box , an important tissue-specific regulatory dna element present in a number of genes expressed in these cell lineages .
4,6 G#DNA|9,13 G#DNA|22,24 G#cell_type

we have analyzed the expression and activity of pu.1 during human b-cell development using a panel of b-cell lines representing different stages of maturation , from early precursors to differentiated plasma cells .
8,9 G#protein|17,19 G#cell_line|26,28 G#cell_line|29,32 G#cell_line

pu.1 mrna expression and pu.1 dna binding activity , as measured by northern blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay , respectively , were evident in cell lines representing pro-b , pre-b , and mature b cells .
0,1 G#protein|0,2 G#RNA|4,5 G#protein|26,28 G#cell_line|29,37 G#cell_line

we could also show pu box -dependent transactivation of a reporter gene in transient transfections in these cell lines .
4,6 G#DNA|17,19 G#cell_line

in contrast , in a number of multiple myeloma cell lines , representing differentiated , plasma cell-like b cells , pu.1 dna binding activity , mrna expression , and pu box -dependent transactivation were absent or detectable at a very low level .
7,11 G#cell_line|13,19 G#cell_type|20,21 G#protein|29,31 G#DNA

in lymphoblastoid cell lines , which exemplify an intermediate stage of b-cell differentiation , a reduced expression and activity were observed .
1,4 G#cell_line

the findings in the human multiple myeloma cell lines represent the first examples of b cells with downregulated pu.1 expression and apparently contradict observations in the murine system in which pu.1 is expressed and active in plasmacytoma cell lines .
5,9 G#cell_line|4,9 G#cell_line|14,16 G#cell_type|18,19 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|36,39 G#cell_line

at present , it is unclear whether the lack of pu.1 expression and activity in human multiple myeloma cell lines represents a malignancy-associated defect in these cells or exemplifies a normal developmental regulation in terminally differentiated b cells .
10,11 G#protein|16,20 G#cell_line|15,20 G#cell_line|36,38 G#cell_type|34,38 G#cell_type

regulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and e-selectin expression in endothelial cells by cyclosporin a and the t-cell transcription factor nfat .
2,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|9,11 G#cell_type|16,19 G#protein|19,20 G#protein

nuclear factor of activated t cells ( nfat ) was originally described as a t-cell-specific transcription factor athat supported the activation of cytokine gene expression and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin a ( csa ) .
0,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|14,17 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

as we observed that activated endothelial cells also expressed nfat , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of csa in endothelial cells .
4,7 G#cell_type|9,10 G#protein|19,21 G#cell_type

significantly , csa completely suppressed the induction of nfat in endothelial cells and inhibited the activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) gene regulatory elements that use nfat by 60 % .
8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|17,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|17,26 G#DNA|28,29 G#protein

csa similarly mediated a reduction of up to 65 % in gm-csf mrna and protein expression in activated endothelial cells .
11,12 G#protein|11,13 G#RNA|17,20 G#cell_type

csa also suppressed e-selectin , but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( vcam-1 ) expression in endothelial cells , even though the e-selectin promoter is activated by nf-kappa b rather than nfat .
3,4 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|22,24 G#DNA|27,29 G#protein|31,32 G#protein

hence , induction of cell surface expression of this leukocyte adhesion molecule by tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) -alpha was reduced by 40 % in the presence of csa , and this was reflected by a 29 % decrease in neutrophil adhesion .
9,12 G#protein|13,20 G#protein|41,42 G#cell_type

the effects of csa on endothelial cells were also detected at the chromatin structure level , as dnasel hypersensitive sites within both the gm-csf enhancer and the e-selectin promoter were suppressed by csa .
5,7 G#cell_type|12,13 G#DNA|17,18 G#protein|17,20 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|27,29 G#DNA

this represents the first report of nfat in endothelial cells and suggests mechanisms by which csa could function as an antiinflammatory agent .

costimulation requirement for ap-1 and nf-kappa b transcription factor activation in t cells .
3,4 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|11,13 G#cell_type

the transcriptional activity of the il-2 promoter requires t-cell costimulation delivered by the tcr and the auxiliary receptor cd28 .
5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#DNA|8,9 G#cell_type|13,14 G#protein|16,19 G#protein

several transcription factors participate in il-2 promoter activation , among which are ap-1 -like factors and nf-kappa b .
1,3 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|12,15 G#protein|16,18 G#protein

protein phosphorylation has an important role in the regulation of these two factors : ( 1 ) it induces the transactivating capacity of the ap-1 protein c-jun ; and ( 2 ) it is involved in the release of the cytoplasmic inhibitor , i kappa b , from nf-kappa b , allowing translocation of the latter into the nucleus .
24,26 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|40,42 G#protein|43,46 G#protein|48,50 G#protein

we have recently shown that both phosphorylation processes require t-cell costimulation .


furthermore , in activated t cells , the kinetics of the two phosphorylation events are essentially similar .
3,6 G#cell_type

according to our results , however , the kinases responsible for the two processes are distinct entities .


whereas tpck inhibits phosphorylation of i kappa b and , consequently , activation of nf-kappa b , it markedly enhances the activity of jnk , the map kinase-related kinase that phosphorylates the transactivation domain of c-jun .
1,2 G#protein|5,8 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|26,29 G#protein|32,34 G#protein|35,36 G#protein

we , therefore , propose the activation scheme presented in figure 3 for t-cell costimulation .


costimulation results in the activation of a signaling pathway that leads to the simultaneous induction of the two transcription factors , ap-1 and nf-kappa b .
18,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,25 G#protein

integration of the signals generated by tcr and cd28 engagement occurs along this pathway , which then bifurcates to induce i kappa b phosphorylation and nf-kappa b activation on the one hand , and jnk activation and c-jun phosphorylation on the other .
6,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|20,23 G#protein|25,27 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|37,38 G#protein

we are currently engaged in defining where the two signals integrate along the ap-1 / nf-kappa b pathway .

regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and cytokine gene expression in myeloid cells by nf-kappa b /rel transcription factors .
12,14 G#cell_type|15,17 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

cd4+ macrophages in tissues such as lung , skin , and lymph nodes , promyelocytic cells in bone marrow , and peripheral blood monocytes serve as important targets and reservoirs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) replication .
0,2 G#cell_line|14,16 G#cell_type|21,24 G#cell_type

hiv-1 -infected myeloid cells are often diminished in their ability to participate in chemotaxis , phagocytosis , and intracellular killing .
2,4 G#cell_type

hiv-1 infection of myeloid cells can lead to the expression of surface receptors associated with cellular activation and/or differentiation that increase the responsiveness of these cells to cytokines secreted by neighboring cells as well as to bacteria or other pathogens .
3,5 G#cell_type|11,13 G#protein|27,28 G#protein

enhancement of hiv-1 replication is related in part to increased dna-binding activity of cellular transcription factors such as nf-kappa b .
14,16 G#protein|13,16 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

nf-kappa b binds to the hiv-1 enhancer region of the long terminal repeat and contributes to the inducibility of hiv-1 gene expression in response to multiple activating agents .
0,2 G#protein|5,7 G#DNA|10,13 G#DNA

phosphorylation and degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor i kappa b alpha are crucial regulatory events in the activation of nf-kappa b dna-binding activity .
5,7 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

both n- and c- terminal residues of i kappa b alpha are required for inducer-mediated degradation .
7,10 G#protein

chronic hiv-1 infection of myeloid cells leads to constitutive nf-kappa b dna-binding activity and provides an intranuclear environment capable of perpetuating hiv-1 replication .
4,6 G#cell_type|9,11 G#protein

increased intracellular stores of latent nf-kappa b may also result in rapid inducibility of nf-kappa b -dependent cytokine gene expression .
5,7 G#protein|4,7 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

in response to secondary pathogenic infections or antigenic challenge , cytokine gene expression is rapidly induced , enhanced , and sustained over prolonged periods in hiv-1 -infected myeloid cells compared with uninfected cells .

4,5 G#cell_type

glucocorticoids kill certain types of lymphoblasts , but the mechanisms are unknown .
5,6 G#cell_type

it is clear that sufficient numbers of functional glucocorticoid receptors are required to mediate lysis , but whether they do so through the classical model of steroid hormone activation and modulation of gene expression has not been established .
8,10 G#protein

in this report we have asked which region ( s ) of the steroid receptor are important for mediating lysis in leukemic t lymphoblasts .

cem-icr 27 leukemic lymphoblasts , a clone of cem cells which lack functional glucocorticoid receptors and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing glutamine synthetase induction , were provided with steroid receptors by dna transfections of various receptor gene constructs .
3,4 G#cell_type|0,4 G#cell_line|8,10 G#cell_line|13,15 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|33,35 G#protein

we measured steroid mediated lysis , receptor number and induction of glutamine synthetase in the transfected cells .
11,13 G#protein|15,17 G#cell_line

our results provide evidence that the lysis mechanism in the icr27 lymphoblasts is restored when functional receptor number is restored .
11,12 G#cell_type|10,12 G#cell_line

the dna binding region specifying high affinity for gre sites is required .
1,4 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA

lysis is mediated by any steroid that allows for activation of the receptor containing such a region .


our data support the view that steroid -mediated cell death occurs by a process requiring direct interaction of steroid -receptor complexes with the genome .

functional characterization of the murine homolog of the b cell-specific coactivator bob.1/obf.1 .
4,6 G#protein|8,11 G#protein|11,12 G#protein

b cell-specific transcriptional promoter activity mediated by the octamer motif requires the oct1 or oct2 protein and additional b cell-restricted cofactors .
8,10 G#DNA|12,13 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|18,21 G#protein

one such cofactor , bob.1/obf.1 , was recently isolated from human b cells .
2,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_type

here , we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of the murine homolog .
11,13 G#protein

full-length cdnas and genomic clones were isolated , and the gene structure was determined . comparison of the deduced amino acids shows 88 % sequence identity between mouse and human bob.1/obf.1 .
1,2 G#DNA|3,5 G#DNA|27,31 G#protein

the nh2-terminal 126 amino acids of bob.1/obf.1 are both essential and sufficient for interaction with the pou domains of either oct1 or oct2 .
1,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

this protein-protein interaction does not require the simultaneous binding of oct proteins to dna , and high resolution footprinting of the oct -dna interaction reveals that binding of bob.1/obf.1 to oct1 or oct2 does not alter the interaction with dna .
10,12 G#protein|21,22 G#DNA|28,29 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

bob.1/obf.1 can efficiently activate octamer-dependent promoters in fibroblasts ; however , it fails to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer activity .
0,1 G#protein|7,8 G#cell_type|15,17 G#DNA

fusion of subdomains of bob.1/obf.1 with the gal4 dna binding domain reveals that both nh2- and cooh- terminal domains of bob.1/obf.1 contribute to full transactivation function , the cooh-terminal domain is more efficient in this transactivation assay .
4,5 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|14,19 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|28,30 G#protein

consistent with the failure of full-length bob.1/obf.1 to stimulate octamer-dependent enhancer elements in non b cells , the gal4 fusions likewise only stimulate from a promoter-proximal position .

anti-immunoglobulin m activates nuclear calcium /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii in human b lymphocytes .
0,2 G#protein|3,9 G#protein|10,13 G#cell_type

we and others have previously shown that the nuclear protein , ets-1 , is phosphorylated in a calcium-dependent manner after ligation of immunoglobulin ( ig ) m on b lymphocytes .
8,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|22,27 G#protein|28,30 G#cell_type

as this phosphorylation was independent of protein kinase c activity , we tested whether a calcium /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ( cam kinase ) might phosphorylate the ets-1 protein after elevation of intracellular free calcium concentrations .
6,9 G#protein|15,19 G#protein|20,22 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|26,28 G#protein

the dephosphorylated form of ets-1 has been shown to bind to chromatin , suggesting that the operative kinase should be detectable in the nucleus .
4,5 G#protein|11,12 G#DNA|16,18 G#protein

we prepared nuclear extracts from two human b cell lines in which increased intracellular free calcium levels correlated with increased phosphorylation of the ets-1 protein .
6,10 G#cell_line|23,24 G#protein

activity of the cam kinases was determined using a synthetic peptide substrate both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor specific for the cam kinase family , kn-62 .
3,5 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|24,27 G#protein

stimulation of cells with anti-igm led to increased activity of a nuclear kinase that could phosphorylate the peptide , and this activity was reduced by 10 microm kn-62 .
4,5 G#protein|11,13 G#protein

kinase activity was reduced in lysates preadsorbed using an antibody specific for cam kinase ii .
9,10 G#protein|12,15 G#protein

two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the ets-1 protein from cells incubated with ionomycin or anti-igm contained two unique phosphopeptides that were absent in untreated cells .
5,6 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

incubation of isolated ets-1 protein with purified cam kinase ii produced phosphorylation of peptides that migrated identically to those found in cells incubated with either anti-igm or ionomycin .
2,5 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

these data suggest a model of signal transduction by the antigen receptor on b lymphocytes in which increased intracellular free calcium can rapidly activate nuclear cam kinase ii , potentially resulting in phosphorylation and regulation of dna-binding proteins .

transcriptional activation and repression , two properties of the lymphoid-specific transcription factor oct-2a .
9,12 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

the lymphoid-specific transcription factor oct-2a contains two transcriptional activation domains which are located within the n-terminal and c-terminal regions .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,19 G#protein

to study their differential activation properties , we linked the isolated effector domains to the gal4 dna-binding domain .
3,6 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|15,18 G#protein

we have shown that both activating regions of oct-2a , isolated from their natural context , can activate transcription as promoter factors .
8,9 G#protein|20,22 G#protein

in contrast to the c-terminus , activation by the n-terminal domain is dependent on a yet unidentified factor ( s ) binding to the simian virus 40 enhancer .
4,5 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|24,28 G#DNA

the results obtained by duplication of activation domains or their mixed combination suggest that the domains are functionally independent .
6,8 G#protein

however , activation from a remote position could only be achieved with the c-terminus of oct-2a in b cells .
13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,19 G#cell_type

in lymphoid cells , higher activation levels were observed , suggesting that distinct b-cell-specific cofactors in concert with the effector domains of oct-2a might be involved in mediating transcription from proximal and remote positions .
1,3 G#cell_type|13,15 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

furthermore , we identified a repression domain at the n-terminus of oct-2a .
11,12 G#protein

when transferred to a potent activator , transcriptional stimulation was inhibited efficiently .


these results underscore the modular structure of oct-2a with separable domains for activation and repression and suggest that oct-2a might have complex regulatory functions in vivo .

nonopsonic phagocytosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes requires the presence of the bacterial flagellum .
6,7 G#cell_type|8,10 G#cell_type

whereas the mechanism of nonopsonic phagocytosis of pseudomonas aeruginosa has been described , the bacterial ligands required are poorly understood .


to identify the requisite bacterial ligands , studies with isogenic mutants of p. aeruginosa pak lacking pili , flagella , and the rpon sigma factor were undertaken .
22,25 G#protein

the rpon mutant , lacking pili , flagella , and nonpilus adhesins , bound poorly and was resistant to ingestion by both macrophages and neutrophils .
10,12 G#protein|22,23 G#cell_type|24,25 G#cell_type

pili were not absolutely required for binding or phagocytosis of p. aeruginosa .


the presence of a flagellum was not required for binding of p. aeruginosa to macrophages but was critical for the subsequent internalization of the bacterium , suggesting that this factor or a surface ligand associated with its assembly was responsible for stimulation of nonopsonic phagocytosis .

identification of essential gata and ets binding motifs within the promoter of the platelet glycoprotein ib alpha gene .
3,4 G#DNA|5,8 G#DNA|13,18 G#DNA

platelet glycoprotein ( gp ) ib-ix-v is a multisubunit adhesion receptor that supports platelet attachment to thrombogenic surfaces at sites of vascular injury .
0,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|8,11 G#protein

the congenital absence of the receptor results in a bleeding disorder associated with " giant " platelets , a condition linking the expression of the complex to platelet morphogenesis .
13,17 G#cell_type

to understand better the expression of the gp ib-ix-v complex , studies were undertaken to define the essential genetic elements supporting the expression of the alpha-subunit of the complex ( gp ib alpha ) .
7,8 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|18,20 G#DNA|25,26 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|30,33 G#protein

gp ib alpha promoter activity was evaluated by transfection of human erythroleukemia cells with reporter plasmids coding for the enzyme , luciferase .
0,1 G#protein|0,4 G#DNA|10,13 G#cell_type|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

studies were initiated with a fragment extending 2,738 nucleotides 5' to the transcription start site and lead to the identification of 253 nucleotides retaining full promoter activity in human erythroleukemia cells .
12,15 G#DNA|28,31 G#cell_type

in cells of nonhematopoietic lineage , human endothelial and hela cells , the gp ib alpha promoter activity was no greater than background levels obtained with promoterless constructs .
3,5 G#cell_type|6,8 G#cell_type|9,11 G#cell_type|13,14 G#protein|13,16 G#protein|13,17 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA

gel shift assays and site-directed mutagenesis studies defined essential gata and ets binding motifs 93 and 150 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site , a finding which further substantiates these elements as important determinants of megakaryocytic gene expression .
9,10 G#DNA|11,14 G#DNA|14,19 G#DNA|21,24 G#DNA

the results define essential cis-acting elements responsible for the expression of gp ib alpha and provide insights into molecular events coinciding with the release of normal platelets into the bloodstream .

cd30 ligation induces nuclear factor-kappa b activation in human t cell lines .
0,1 G#protein|3,6 G#protein|8,12 G#cell_line

cd30 is a recently described member of the tumor necrosis factor /nerve growth factor receptor superfamily .
0,1 G#protein|8,11 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|8,16 G#protein

in this report , we show that following incubation of l540 cells ( hodgkin 's disease -derived , t cell-like , cd30 + cells ) with the agonistic anti- cd30 monoclonal antibodies ( mab ) m44 and m67 , two nuclear factor ( nf ) -kappa b dna binding activities were induced in nuclear extracts , as determined in gel retardation assays .
10,12 G#cell_line|21,22 G#protein|13,24 G#cell_line|29,30 G#protein|27,32 G#protein|33,34 G#protein|35,36 G#protein|37,38 G#protein|40,47 G#protein

the effect of the mab towards nf-kappa b activation was rapid , as it occurred within 20 min , and was sustained for up to 6 h .
4,5 G#protein|6,8 G#protein

by comparison , an isotype-matched antibody had no effect on nf-kappa b activation .
4,6 G#protein|10,12 G#protein

moreover , in human t helper ( th ) clones functionally characterized as being of the type 0 , type 1 and type 2 ( 28 % , &lt; 1 % und 93 % cd30+ , respectively ) , the extent of cd30 -mediated nf-kappa b activation correlated with the proportion of cd30+ cells .
3,10 G#cell_line|42,43 G#protein|44,46 G#protein|52,54 G#cell_line

in all cell lines investigated , the nf-kappa b complexes induced following cd30 engagement were shown to contain p50 nf-kappa b1 , p65 rela , and possibly other transcription factors .
7,9 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|18,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|28,30 G#protein

collectively , our results demonstrate that nuclear translocation and activation of nf-kappa b rank among the short-term cellular responses elicited following cd30 ligation .

pathogenesis of atherosclerosis .


the earliest lesion in the development of an atherosclerotic plaque is the fatty streak .


this chronic inflammatory reaction results from a sequence of events that begins with the trapping of low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) in the subendothelial space of the artery wall .


the trapped ldl is seeded with oxidative species released by the overlying endothelium , and lipid oxidation is initiated within the ldl particle . some of the lipids that result lead to the activation of nfkb-like transcription factors that cause the expression of genes whose protein products mediate monocyte binding , monocyte chemotaxis into the subendothelial space , and conversion into macrophages .
36,38 G#protein|35,38 G#protein|45,47 G#protein|51,52 G#cell_type|61,62 G#cell_type

at least 1 major gene modulates the oxidation of ldl lipids and/or the biologic response to these lipids .
3,5 G#DNA

the inverse relation between high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) and atherosclerotic events may in part be due to enzymes associated with hdl that destroy the biologically active lipids generated in ldl .

0,1 G#protein|2,4 G#protein

purpose : sex-related influences have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vernal keratoconjunctivitis ( vkc ) , an allergic eosinophilic disease .


methods : the authors evaluated tarsal and bulbar conjunctival biopsies from seven patients with severe and symptomatic vkc for the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors by using monoclonal antibodies with a peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique .
22,23 G#protein|24,26 G#protein|28,30 G#protein

results : both the epithelium and subepithelium of the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva of patients with vkc , but not those of four nonatopic control subjects , showed intense positive staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors .
34,36 G#protein

immunofluorescence colocalization of both estrogen and progesterone receptors with eosinophil cationic protein showed that approximately 70 % of positive cells were eosinophils .
4,5 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|9,12 G#protein|18,20 G#cell_type|21,22 G#cell_type

conclusions : sexual hormones , through their receptors , may influence the activity of eosinophils in patients with vkc .

ciita activates the expression of mhc class ii genes in mouse t cells .
0,1 G#protein|5,9 G#DNA

it has long been a puzzle that mhc class ii molecules are expressed in human t cells after activation but not in mouse t cells ; this expression is believed to play a role in the cell mediated immune response .
7,11 G#protein|14,17 G#cell_type|22,25 G#cell_type

recently the mhc class ii transactivator ( ciita ) has been reported to be a major regulatory factor for both the constitutive and ifn inducible expression of mhc class ii genes .
2,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|27,31 G#DNA

here we show that human t cells expressing mhc class ii have ciita transcripts while mhc class ii-negative human t cells and mouse t cells do not .
4,7 G#cell_type|12,13 G#protein|18,21 G#cell_type|22,25 G#cell_type

the expression of mhc class ii genes in mouse t cells can be reconstituted upon transfection with the human ciita cdna .
3,7 G#DNA|8,11 G#cell_type|19,20 G#protein|18,21 G#DNA

these data indicate that the expression of ciita explains the expression or lack of expression of mhc class ii in human and mouse t cells respectively .

anti-ro(ssa) autoantibodies are associated with t cell receptor beta genes in systemic lupus erythematosus patients .
0,2 G#protein|5,10 G#DNA

several of the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus have been associated with specific autoantibodies .
15,16 G#protein

associations between hla class ii antigens and autoantibodies to the ribonucleoproteins ro(ssa) and la(ssb) have been reported in these patients .
2,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

because hla class ii molecules present antigen to t cell receptors ( tcrs ) , we have searched for a tcr gene associated with the production of anti- ro(ssa) antibodies .
1,5 G#protein|8,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|20,22 G#DNA|28,29 G#protein|27,30 G#protein

a pair of restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( rflps ) , one of which hybridizes to the tcr constant region c beta 1 and the other to the c beta 2 gene , has been identified , suggesting these may be genotypic markers for an extended region of the tcr beta locus .
3,7 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|17,23 G#DNA|28,32 G#DNA|49,52 G#DNA

this rflp pair occurs in 76 % of patients with ro(ssa) precipitins , 84 % of anti- ro(ssa) -positive patients lacking la(ssb) precipitins , but only 41 % of the patients lacking both precipitins ( p = 0.0004 ) .
1,3 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|33,34 G#protein

this disproportionate occurrence in a subset of lupus patients indicates that these rflps are not disease susceptibility markers , but rather are important markers for tcr genes whose products are involved in the production of anti- ro(ssa) antibodies .
12,13 G#DNA|25,27 G#DNA|36,37 G#protein|35,38 G#protein

the majority of patients who have these rflps and hla class ii antigens previously associated with the anti- ro(ssa) response make this antibody , suggesting that interactions between products of these loci occur in response to ro(ssa) .

inhibition of nf-at -dependent transcription by nf-kappa b : implications for differential gene expression in t helper cell subsets .
2,3 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|15,19 G#cell_type

activation of individual cd4+ t cells results in differential lymphokine expression : interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) is preferentially produced by t helper type 1 ( th1 ) cells , which are involved in cell-mediated immune responses , whereas il-4 is synthesized by th2 cells , which are essential for humoral immunity .
3,6 G#cell_line|9,10 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|21,29 G#cell_line|39,40 G#protein|43,45 G#cell_line

the ca(2+) -dependent factor nf-atp plays a key role in the inducible transcription of both these lymphokine genes .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|16,18 G#DNA

however , while il2 expression requires the contribution of ca(2+)- and protein kinase c -dependent signals , we report that activation of human il4 transcription through the ca(2+)-dependent pathway is diminished by protein kinase c stimulation in jurkat t cells .
3,4 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|32,35 G#protein|37,40 G#cell_line

this phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of nf-atp and nf-kappa b to the p sequence , an element located 69 bp upstream of the il4 transcription initiation site .
9,10 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|15,17 G#DNA|21,24 G#DNA|26,30 G#DNA

human il4 promoter -mediated transcription is downregulated in jurkat cells stimulated with the nf-kappa b -activating cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha and suppressed in rela -overexpressing cells .
0,3 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_line|13,15 G#protein|13,17 G#protein|17,21 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|24,27 G#cell_line

in contrast , protein kinase c stimulation or rela overexpression does not affect the activity of a human il4 promoter containing a mouse p sequence , which is a higher-affinity site for nf-atp and a lower-affinity site for rela .
3,6 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|17,20 G#DNA|23,25 G#DNA|22,25 G#DNA|29,31 G#DNA|32,33 G#protein|35,37 G#DNA|38,39 G#protein

thus , competition between two general transcriptional activators , rela and nf-atp , mediates the inhibitory effect of protein kinase c stimulation on il4 expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in th cells .

regulation of the balance of cytokine production and the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ) transcription factor activity by cytokines and inflammatory synovial fluids .
5,6 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

the balance between type 1 and 2 t helper cell cytokine production plays an important role in several animal models of autoimmunity , and skewed patterns of cytokine expression have been described in human inflammatory diseases .
27,28 G#protein

many cytokines activate signal transducer and activation of transcription ( stat ) transcription factors , which , in turn , activate transcription of inflammatory effector genes .
1,2 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|3,14 G#protein

we used mononuclear cell priming cultures and inflammatory synovial fluids ( sfs ) derived from arthritis patients to examine the regulation of cytokine production and stat activity by an inflammatory synovial microenvironment .
2,6 G#cell_line|7,10 G#cell_type|11,12 G#cell_type|22,23 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

exposure to sfs during priming resulted in an 81 % inhibition of interferon ( ifn ) -gamma , but not interleukin ( il ) 4 , production by effector cells generated in priming cultures .
2,3 G#cell_type|12,17 G#protein|20,25 G#protein|28,30 G#cell_type

sf suppression was mediated by il-4 and il-10 and inhibition of il-12 expression , and it was reversed in a dominant fashion by exogenous il-12 .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|11,12 G#protein

sfs blocked the sustained activity of transcription factor stat1 , but not stat3 , during the priming period , and stat1 activity was differentially regulated by cytokines in parallel with their positive or negative regulation of ifn-gamma production .
0,1 G#cell_type|6,9 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|20,21 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

active stat3 , but not stat1 , was detected in cells from inflamed joints .
1,2 G#protein|5,6 G#protein

these results suggest a role for altered balance of stat1 and stat3 transcriptional activity in the regulation of t cell differentiation and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory synovitis .

triggering of complement receptors cr1 ( cd35 ) and cr3 ( cd11b/cd18 ) induces nuclear translocation of nf-kappa b ( p50 /p65 ) in human monocytes and enhances viral replication in hiv-infected monocytic cells .

monocyte/macrophages may harbor hiv in a nonproductive fashion for prolonged periods of time .
0,1 G#cell_type

viral gene expression may be reactivated by stimulation of the cells with lps or cytokines such as tnf-alpha in vitro .
14,15 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

the effect of lps and tnf-alpha is mediated by their ability to induce nuclear translocation of the dna-binding heterodimer nf-kappa b ( p50 /p65 ) , which binds to a specific sequence in the hiv-long terminal repeat .
5,6 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,24 G#protein|34,37 G#DNA

the present study demonstrates that triggering of complement receptors cr1 ( cd35 ) and cr3 ( cd11b/cd18 ) enhances viral replication in hiv-infected human monocytic cells .
7,9 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|22,26 G#cell_line

monocytic cell lines and normal peripheral blood monocytes were infected with hiv-1 in vitro and cultured in the presence or absence of f(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal anti- cr1 or anti- cr3 abs or with c3 fragments .
0,3 G#cell_line|22,24 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|25,28 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|29,32 G#protein|34,36 G#protein

stimulation of cr1 or cr3 induces a two- to fourfold increase in the amount of cell-associated and released p24 ag in cell cultures that was equivalent to that observed in control cultures triggered with lps .
2,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|21,23 G#cell_line|30,32 G#cell_line

we further observed that stimulation of cr1 or cr3 induces the nuclear translocation of nf-kappa b p50 /p65 in infected cells .
6,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|16,18 G#protein|19,21 G#cell_type

translocation of nf-kappa b p50 /p65 was also observed following stimulation of cr1 or cr3 of uninfected peripheral blood monocytes from hiv-seronegative donors .
2,4 G#protein|4,6 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|16,20 G#cell_type

the amount of protein translocated was similar to that observed when cells were stimulated with rhtnf-alpha .
15,16 G#protein

tnf-alpha did not mediate the translocation of nf-kappa b p50 /p65 induced by triggering of complement receptors .
0,1 G#protein|7,9 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

taken together , these observations suggest that hiv gene expression may be activated in infected monocytes through interaction of the cells with complement-opsonized particles and that enhanced viral replication is associated with c3 receptor -mediated nuclear translocation of the nf-kappa b complex .

the induction of gene transcription in response to gamma interferon is impaired in mononuclear phagocytes infected with leishmania donovani , and the mechanisms involved are not fully understood .
8,10 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_type

the changes in gene expression brought about by gamma interferon are thought to involve transient increases in the activities of cellular protein tyrosine kinases , including the janus kinases jak1 and jak2 , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor stat1 .

to investigate the mechanisms accounting for the impaired responses to gamma interferon , a model system for examining overall changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation , activation of jak1 and jak2 and phosphorylation of stat1 was developed in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate -differentiated u-937 cells .
10,12 G#protein|27,28 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|33,34 G#protein|37,43 G#cell_line

analysis of whole-cell lysates by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting showed that incubation with gamma interferon brought about specific increases in phosphotyrosine labeling of several proteins .
11,13 G#protein

increased labeling of these proteins occurred to similar extents in control cells and in cells that had been infected with l. donovani for 16 h .
10,12 G#cell_type

jak1 , jak2 , and stat1 were immunoprecipitated from control and interferon-treated cells , and tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins , detected by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting was used to measured their activation .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|11,13 G#cell_line

tyrosine phosphorylation of jak1 , jak2 , and stat1 increased markedly , in a dose-dependent manner , in u-937 cells incubated with gamma interferon .
3,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|18,20 G#cell_line|22,24 G#protein

in contrast , in cells infected with l. donovani , tyrosine phosphorylation of jak1 , jak2 , and stat1 was markedly impaired .
13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|18,19 G#protein

this effect was dependent upon the duration of exposure to l. donovani and was maximal and complete at 16 h .


results similar to those observed with u-937 cells were also obtained with human peripheral blood monocytes .
6,8 G#cell_line|12,16 G#cell_type

these findings indicate that infection of human mononuclear phagocytes with l. donovani leads to impaired gamma interferon -mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and selective effects on the jak- stat1 pathway .
6,9 G#cell_type|15,17 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

unresponsiveness to gamma interferon for activation of this pathway may explain impaired transcriptional responses in leishmania-infected cells .

mutually exclusive interaction of a novel matrix attachment region binding protein and the nf-munr enhancer repressor .

implications for regulation of immunoglobulin heavy chain expression .
4,7 G#protein

the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( igh ) intronic enhancer stimulates transcription from functional promoters in b lymphocytes but not other cell types .
1,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein

the observation that binding sites for the nuclear factor-mu negative regulator ( nf-munr ) enhancer repressor overlap nuclear matrix attachment regions ( mars ) in this enhancer has lead to the hypothesis that the cell type specificity of the enhancer might be controlled by regulating nuclear matrix attachment ( scheuermann , r. h. , and chen , u. ( 1989 ) genes &amp; dev. 3 , 1255-1266 ) .
7,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|17,21 G#protein|7,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein|26,27 G#DNA|39,40 G#DNA

to understand the role of mars in igh enhancer regulation , we have identified a novel mar-binding protein , mar-bp1 , from soluble nuclear matrix preparations based on its ability to bind to the mars associated with the igh enhancer .
5,6 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|7,9 G#DNA|16,18 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|38,39 G#protein|38,40 G#DNA

purified mar-bp1 migrates as a 33-kda protein , and it can be found in nuclear matrix preparations from a number of different types of lymphoid cell lines .
1,2 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|24,27 G#cell_line

although specific binding sites have been difficult to localize by chemical or enzymatic footprinting procedures , nf-munr binding sites are critical for efficient mar-bp1 binding .
16,17 G#protein|23,24 G#protein

indeed , binding of the igh enhancer to either intact nuclear matrix preparations or to mar-bp1 is mutually exclusive to nf-munr binding .
5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#DNA|15,16 G#protein|20,21 G#protein

these results are consistent with a model for cell-type specific regulation in which binding of the nf-munr repressor to the igh enhancer prevents nuclear matrix attachment in inappropriate cells by interfering with mar-bp1 /enhancer interaction .

pu.1 ( spi-1 ) and c/ebp alpha regulate expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor alpha gene .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|5,7 G#protein|11,15 G#protein|11,17 G#DNA

growth factor receptors play an important role in hematopoiesis .
0,3 G#protein

in order to further understand the mechanisms directing the expression of these key regulators of hematopoiesis , we initiated a study investigating the transcription factors activating the expression of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( gm-csf ) receptor alpha gene .
23,25 G#protein|30,33 G#protein|34,35 G#protein|30,39 G#DNA

here , we demonstrate that the human gm-csf receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity in a tissue-specific fashion in myelomonocytic cells , which correlates with its expression pattern as analyzed by reverse transcription pcr .
7,8 G#protein|7,10 G#protein|6,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|20,22 G#cell_type

the gm-csf receptor alpha promoter contains an important functional site between positions -53 and -41 as identified by deletion analysis of reporter constructs .
1,2 G#protein|1,4 G#protein|1,5 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA

we show that the myeloid and b cell transcription factor pu.1 binds specifically to this site .
6,10 G#protein|10,11 G#protein

furthermore , we demonstrate that a ccaat site located upstream of the pu.1 site between positions -70 and -54 is involved in positive-negative regulation of the gm-csf receptor alpha promoter activity .
6,8 G#DNA|12,13 G#protein|12,14 G#DNA|26,27 G#protein|26,29 G#protein|26,30 G#DNA

c/ebp alpha is the major ccaat/enhancer -binding protein ( c/ebp ) form binding to this site in nuclear extracts of u937 cells .
0,2 G#protein|5,6 G#DNA|5,8 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_line

point mutations of either the pu.1 site or the c/ebp site that abolish the binding of the respective factors result in a significant decrease of gm-csf receptor alpha promoter activity in myelomonocytic cells only .
5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#DNA|9,10 G#protein|9,11 G#DNA|25,26 G#protein|25,28 G#protein|25,29 G#DNA|31,33 G#cell_type

furthermore , we demonstrate that in myeloid and b cell extracts , pu.1 forms a novel , specific , more slowly migrating complex ( pu-sf ) when binding the gm-csf receptor alpha promoter pu.1 site .
12,13 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|29,32 G#protein|29,33 G#DNA|33,34 G#protein|33,35 G#DNA

this is the first demonstration of a specific interaction with pu.1 on a myeloid pu.1 binding site .
10,11 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|13,17 G#DNA

the novel complex is distinct from that described previously as binding to b cell enhancer sites and can be formed by addition of pu.1 to extracts from certain nonmyeloid cell types which do not express pu.1 , including t cells and epithelial cells , but not from erythroid cells .
12,16 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein|28,31 G#cell_type|35,36 G#protein|38,40 G#cell_type|41,43 G#cell_type|47,49 G#cell_type

furthermore , we demonstrate that the pu-sf complex binds to pu.1 sites found on a number of myeloid promoters , and its formation requires an intact pu.1 site adjacent to a single-stranded region .
6,7 G#protein|6,8 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|17,19 G#DNA|26,27 G#protein|26,28 G#DNA

expression of pu.1 in nonmyeloid cells can activate the gm-csf receptor alpha promoter .
2,3 G#protein|4,6 G#cell_type|9,10 G#protein|9,13 G#DNA

deletion of the amino-terminal region of pu.1 results in a failure to form the pu-sf complex and in a concomitant loss of transactivation , suggesting that formation of the pu-sf complex is of functional importance for the activity of the gm-csf receptor alpha promoter .
3,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|29,31 G#protein|40,41 G#protein|40,44 G#DNA

hmg-i binds to gata motifs : implications for an hpfh syndrome .
0,1 G#protein|3,5 G#DNA

we have examined binding of the nuclear protein hmg-i to the human gamma-globin promoter .
6,8 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|11,14 G#DNA

we find that hmg-i binds preferentially to the more 3' of a pair of gata motifs in the gamma-globin promoter ; this paired motif is bound by the erythroid factor gata-1 .
3,4 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA|30,31 G#protein|28,31 G#protein

a naturally occurring mutation ( -175 t-c ) in the area bound by hmg-i results in overexpression of gamma-globin in adult red blood cells ( hpfh ) and up-regulation of the gamma-globin promoter in in vitro expression assays ; hmg-i does not bind to this mutant sequence .
13,14 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|20,24 G#cell_type|25,26 G#cell_type|31,32 G#protein|31,33 G#DNA|39,40 G#protein|45,47 G#DNA

a survey of gata motifs from other globin cis-elements demonstrates hmg-i binding to most of them .
3,5 G#DNA|7,9 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein

these findings implicate hmg-i in the hpfh phenotype ; we speculate that it may participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate globin gene expression .

htlv-1 infection causes an adult t cell leukemia in humans .


the viral encoded protein tax , is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein

our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but not thymocytes , despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues .
6,7 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|14,16 G#cell_type|18,19 G#cell_type|24,25 G#protein

constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kd protein ( s ) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast b line and in htlv-1 transformed human lymphoid lines , but not in thymocytes from thy-tax transgenic mice .
5,7 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|15,19 G#cell_line|21,26 G#cell_line|30,31 G#cell_type

phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis with a set of jak kinase specific antibodies , identified p130 as jak2 in the tax transformed mouse fibroblastic cell line and jak3 in htlv-1 transformed human t cell lines .

phosphorylation of jak2 in tax transformed cells resulted from high expression of il-6 .
2,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|4,7 G#cell_line|12,13 G#protein

tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could also be induced in balb/c3t3 cells using a supernatant from the b line , which was associated with induction of cell proliferation .

both phosphorylation and proliferation were inhibited by il-6 neutralizing antibodies .

regulation of c-jun mrna expression by hydroxyurea in human k562 cells during erythroid differentiation [ published erratum appears in biochim biophys acta 1995 dec 27 ; 1264 ( 3 ) : 409 ]
2,3 G#DNA|2,4 G#RNA|8,11 G#cell_line

hydroxyurea ( hu ) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation .


in addition , hu stimulates the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell anemia patients .
8,10 G#protein

to further understand its mechanism of action , we investigated the effects of hu on regulation of c-jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of k562 cells .
17,18 G#DNA|27,29 G#cell_line

hu induced a dose-dependent stimulation of c-jun synthesis .
6,7 G#DNA

the levels of c-jun mrna was elevated 4 to 7.5-fold by hu within 2 h .
3,4 G#DNA|3,5 G#RNA

this was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h .


both nuclear run-on and actinomycin d pulse experiments strongly indicate that hu regulates c-jun mrna expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c-jun mrna .
13,15 G#RNA|27,28 G#DNA|27,29 G#RNA

in addition , the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5-fold within 4 h in hu treated cells .
6,8 G#protein|18,21 G#cell_line

furthermore , concentrations of hu below 250 microm slightly increased the 5x ap-1 /cat activity .
12,13 G#protein|13,14 G#protein

these results strongly suggest that hu induces both transcriptional and post-transcription regulation of c-jun during erythroid differentiation .

in vivo and in vitro effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation in man : relationship to glucocorticoid receptors .
16,18 G#protein

interrelations between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system ( hpa ) and the immune system represent a well-documented biological phenomenon .


while in vitro administration of glucocorticoids may inhibit concanavalin a ( con a ) - and phytohemagglutinin ( pha ) - induced t-cell proliferation , pokeweed mitogen ( pwm ) -driven b-cell mitogenesis is relatively resistant to glucocorticoids .
25,27 G#protein|28,29 G#protein

to further explore the link between the hpa and the immune system in relation to glucocorticoid receptor function , dose-response curves were obtained for con a - and pha -induced t-cell mitogenesis , pwm -generated b-cell mitogenesis and spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in 13 healthy controls .
15,17 G#protein|28,29 G#protein|33,34 G#protein

glucocorticoid effects were assessed in vivo by depletion of endogenous glucocorticoids after oral administration of 1.5 g metyrapone ( met ) and subsequent glucocorticoid replacement , and in vitro by incubation of the cells with different doses of dexamethasone ( dex ) .


there was a significant decrease in pwm -induced b-cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of dex administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after met treatment when compared with the dex plus met pretreated condition in vivo .
6,7 G#protein

these data suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro is related to glucocorticoid receptor function .
17,19 G#protein

the decrease in pwm -generated b-cell proliferation following cortisol depletion by met may be seen in connection with impaired glucocorticoid -mediated induction of interleukin-1 receptor synthesis .
3,4 G#protein|23,25 G#protein

transcription specific differences visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization pattern on interphase nuclei of different cell types .


application of a " formamide free " and thus " material preserving " in situ hybridization technique using the cdna of the myf3 gene revealed the following results : human rhabdomyosarcoma cells , characterized by a high expression of myf3 show intensive hybridization signals in their interphase .
19,20 G#DNA|22,24 G#DNA|29,32 G#cell_type|39,40 G#DNA

rnase treatment prior to hybridization considerably reduces the size of this signals .
0,1 G#protein

in comparison , isolated nuclei of human lymphocytes in which no need for the expression of this gene exists , show barely hybridization signals .
6,8 G#cell_type

correspondingly , rnase treatment had no effect on hybridization pattern at all .
2,3 G#protein

in conclusion an increased transcription efficiency of a cell type specific gene is accompanied by a higher hybridization accessibility in the corresponding cell nuclei .


oncogenicity of human papillomavirus- or adenovirus- transformed cells correlates with resistance to lysis by natural killer cells .
2,8 G#cell_line|14,17 G#cell_type

the reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses ( hpv ) in humans are unknown but may relate to differences in the capacities of the e1a and e7 proteins to target cells for rejection by the host natural killer ( nk ) cell response .
29,30 G#protein|31,33 G#protein|34,36 G#cell_type|40,47 G#cell_type

as one test of this hypothesis , we compared the abilities of e1a - and e7 -expressing human fibroblastic or keratinocyte-derived human cells to be selectively killed by either unstimulated or interferon ( ifn ) -activated nk cells .
12,13 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,23 G#cell_line|29,30 G#cell_type|31,38 G#cell_line

cells expressing the e1a oncoprotein were selectively killed by unstimulated nk cells , while the same parental cells but expressing the hpv type 16 ( hpv-16 ) or hpv-18 e7 oncoprotein were resistant to nk cell lysis .
3,4 G#protein|3,5 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_line|16,18 G#cell_type|29,30 G#protein|29,31 G#protein

the ability of ifn-activated nk cells to selectively kill virally transformed cells depends on ifn 's ability to induce resistance to nk cell lysis in normal ( i.e. , non-viral oncogene-expressing ) but not virally transformed cells .
3,6 G#cell_line|14,15 G#protein|29,31 G#cell_line|34,37 G#cell_line

e1a blocked ifn 's induction of cytolytic resistance , resulting in the selective lysis of adenovirus-transformed cells by ifn -activated nk cells .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|15,17 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|18,22 G#cell_line

the extent of ifn -induced nk cell killing of e1a -expressing cells was proportional to the level of e1a expression and correlated with the ability of e1a to block ifn -stimulated gene expression in target cells .
3,4 G#protein|9,10 G#protein|9,12 G#cell_line|18,19 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|29,30 G#protein|34,36 G#cell_type

in contrast , e7 blocked neither ifn -stimulated gene expression nor ifn 's induction of cytolytic resistance , thereby precluding the selective lysis of hpv -transformed cells by ifn -activated nk cells .
3,4 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|24,27 G#cell_line|28,29 G#protein|28,32 G#cell_line

in conclusion , e1a expression marks cells for destruction by the host nk cell response , whereas the e7 oncoprotein lacks this activity .

regulation of ikb alpha phosphorylation by pkc- and ca(2+)- dependent signal transduction pathways .
2,4 G#protein

the ca(2+) -dependent phosphatase calcineurin , a target of fk506 and csa , synergizes with pkc -induced activation of nuclear factor ( nf ) -kappa b in t cell lines .
1,4 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|19,26 G#protein|27,30 G#cell_line

we have investigated whether this synergy is present in other cell types and the mechanism ( s ) by which these two pathways lead to nf-kappa b activation .
25,27 G#protein

while this synergy is present in other cell types , in the monocytic cell line u937 calcineurin is also sufficient to activate nf-kappa b .
12,16 G#cell_line|16,17 G#protein|22,24 G#protein

having previously shown that ca(2+)- and pkc- dependent pathways synergize by accelerating the degradation of ikb alpha , we focused on the regulation of ikb alpha phosphorylation .
15,17 G#protein|24,26 G#protein

while pkc -dependent pathways sequentially result in the phosphorylation and in an incomplete degradation of ikb alpha in t cell lines , co-activation of ca(2+) -dependent pathways accelerates the rate of ikb alpha phosphorylation and results in its complete degradation .
1,2 G#protein|15,17 G#protein|18,21 G#cell_line|31,33 G#protein

activation of ca(2+) -dependent pathways alone do not result in the phosphorylation and/or degradation of ikb alpha in jurkat t or in u937 cells .
15,17 G#protein|18,20 G#cell_line|22,24 G#cell_line

treatment of t cells with the selective pkc inhibitor gf109203x abrogates the pma -induced ikb alpha phosphorylation /degradation irrespective of activation of ca(2+) -dependent pathways , but not the phosphorylation and degradation of ikb alpha induced by tnf-alpha , a pkc -independent stimulus .
2,4 G#cell_type|7,8 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|33,35 G#protein|37,38 G#protein|40,41 G#protein

contrary to the interaction with pkc , ca(2+) -dependent pathways synergize with tnf-alpha not at the level of ikb alpha phosphorylation , but at the level of its degradation .
5,6 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

these results indicate that ca(2+) -dependent pathways , including the phosphatase calcineurin , participate in the regulation of nf-kappa b in a cell specific fashion and synergize with pkc -dependent and -independent pathways at the level of ikb alpha phosphorylation and degradation .

vitamin e therapy of acute ccl4 -induced hepatic injury in mice is associated with inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b binding .
16,20 G#protein

oxidative stress , with reactive oxygen intermediate formation , may represent a common mechanism by which liver injury is induced by diverse etiologies .


oxidative stress enhances nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-kappa b ) activity , and nf-kappa b activity has been shown to enhance the expression of cytotoxic cytokines .
3,7 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|25,27 G#protein

acute hepatic injury caused by reactive oxygen intermediate production was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of ccl4 in mice .


this injury was significantly inhibited by intravenous pretreatment of the mice with a water-soluble emulsion of alpha-tocopherol .


alpha-tocopherol treatment of the mice given the ccl4 also reduced the nf-kappa b binding to levels approaching those found in normal mice .
11,13 G#protein

in vitro treatment of a monocyte/macrophage cell line with ccl4 led to enhanced nf-kappa b binding and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf-alpha ) messenger rna levels .
13,15 G#protein|20,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|20,28 G#RNA

liver specimens taken from patients with acute fulminant hepatitis had markedly increased nf-kappa b binding activity in comparison with the binding of normal livers .
12,14 G#protein

these data demonstrate that abolishing acute hepatic injury with alpha-tocopherol , a free radical scavenger , also eliminated increased nf-kappa b binding .
19,21 G#protein

it is tempting to speculate that enhanced nf-kappa b expression caused by free radical production/oxidative stress may modulate liver injury , perhaps through an effect on cytotoxic cytokine synthesis .

immunosuppression by glucocorticoids : inhibition of nf-kappa b activity through induction of i kappa b synthesis [ see comments ]
6,8 G#protein|12,15 G#protein

glucocorticoids are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents .


they inhibit synthesis of almost all known cytokines and of several cell surface molecules required for immune function , but the mechanism underlying this activity has been unclear . here it is shown that glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-kappa b ) activation in mice and cultured cells .
7,8 G#protein|11,14 G#protein|39,43 G#protein|44,46 G#protein|51,53 G#cell_line

this inhibition is mediated by induction of the i kappa b alpha inhibitory protein , which traps activated nf-kappa b in inactive cytoplasmic complexes .
8,11 G#protein|18,20 G#protein|21,24 G#protein

because nf-kappa b activates many immunoregulatory genes in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli , the inhibition of its activity can be a major component of the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids .

transcriptional repression of the interleukin-2 gene by vitamin d3 : direct inhibition of nfatp /ap-1 complex formation by a nuclear hormone receptor .
4,6 G#DNA|13,16 G#protein|19,22 G#protein

t- lymphocyte proliferation is suppressed by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 [ 1,25(oh)2d3 ] , the active metabolite of vitamin d3 , and is associated with a decrease in interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) , gamma interferon , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mrna levels .


we report here that 1,25(oh)2d3 -mediated repression in jurkat cells is cycloheximide resistant , suggesting that it is a direct transcriptional repressive effect on il-2 expression by the vitamin d3 receptor ( vdr ) .
8,10 G#cell_line|24,25 G#protein|28,31 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

we therefore examined vitamin d3 -mediated repression of activated il-2 expression by cotransfecting jurkat cells with il-2 promoter /reporter constructs and a vdr overexpression vector and by dna binding .
9,10 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_line|16,17 G#protein|16,20 G#DNA|22,23 G#protein|22,25 G#DNA

we delineated an element conferring both dna binding by the receptor in vitro and 1,25(oh)2d3 -mediated repression in vivo to a short 40-bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , nf-at-1 , which is bound by a t-cell-specific transcription factor , nfatp , as well as by ap-1 .
22,24 G#DNA|27,30 G#DNA|31,32 G#DNA|38,41 G#protein|42,43 G#protein|48,49 G#protein

vdr dna-binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the vdr dna-binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress il-2 expression .
0,1 G#protein|0,3 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|19,22 G#protein|34,35 G#protein

these results indicate that dna binding by vdr is necessary but not sufficient to mediate il-2 repression .
7,8 G#protein|15,16 G#protein

by combining partially purified proteins in vitro , we observed the loss of the bound nfatp /ap-1-dna complex upon inclusion of vdr or vdr -retinoid x receptor .
2,5 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|15,18 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|23,27 G#protein

order of addition and off-rate experiments indicate that the vdr -retinoid x receptor heterodimer blocks nfatp / ap-1 complex formation and then stably associates with the nf-at-1 element .
9,10 G#protein|9,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|15,19 G#protein|26,27 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA

this direct inhibition by a nuclear hormone receptor of transcriptional activators of the il-2 gene may provide a mechanistic explanation of how vitamin derivatives can act as potent immunosuppressive agents .

5,6 G#protein|4,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_type|12,14 G#DNA

the 15-lipoxygenase ( lox ) gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner , predominantly in erythroid cells but also in airway epithelial cells and eosinophils .
1,6 G#DNA|15,17 G#cell_type|20,23 G#cell_type|24,25 G#cell_type

we demonstrate in this report that the 5' flanking dna of the 15-lox gene contains sequences which down-regulate its activity in a variety of non-erythroid cell lines but not in two erythroid cell lines .
7,10 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|24,27 G#cell_line|31,34 G#cell_line

the element has characteristics of a transcriptional ' silencer ' since it functions in both orientations .
6,10 G#DNA

the main activity of the silencer has been mapped to the first 900 bp of 5' flanking dna , which contains nine binding sites for a nuclear factor present in non- erythroid cells but not in erythroid cells .
5,6 G#DNA|15,18 G#DNA|26,28 G#protein|31,33 G#cell_type|36,38 G#cell_type

these binding sites have similar sequences and multiple copies of the binding sites confer tissue-specific down-regulation when attached to a minimal lox promoter fragment .
11,13 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA|20,24 G#DNA

the 5' flanking dna also contains a cluster of three binding sites for the gata family of transcription factors .
1,4 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|14,16 G#protein|17,19 G#protein

phosphorylation of the transcription factor nfatp inhibits its dna binding activity in cyclosporin a-treated human b and t cells .
3,5 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|12,16 G#cell_line|17,19 G#cell_type

cyclosporin a ( csa ) exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the activity of nuclear factor of activated t cells ( nfat ) , thus preventing transcriptional induction of several cytokine genes .
14,16 G#protein|18,20 G#cell_type|21,22 G#protein

this effect is thought to be largely mediated through inactivation of the phosphatase calcineurin , which in turn inhibits translocation of an nfat component to the nucleus .
13,14 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

here we report that csa treatment of raji b and jurkat t cell lines yields a phosphorylated form of nfatp that is inhibited in dna-binding and in its ability to form an nfat complex with fos and jun .
7,9 G#cell_line|11,14 G#cell_line|10,14 G#cell_line|19,20 G#protein|32,34 G#protein|35,36 G#protein|37,38 G#protein

immunoblot analyses and metabolic labeling with [32p]orthophosphate show that csa alters nfatp migration on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by increasing its phosphorylation level without affecting subcellular distribution .
11,12 G#protein

dephosphorylation by in vitro treatment with calcineurin or alkaline phosphatase restores nfatp dna binding activity and its ability to reconstitute an nfat complex with fos and jun proteins .
6,7 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|21,23 G#protein|24,25 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

these data point to a new mechanism for csa -sensitive regulation of nfatp in which dephosphorylation is critical for dna binding .

transcription factors as targets for oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .
0,2 G#protein

we previously have demonstrated a requirement for oxidative events during cell cycle entry in t lymphocytes and have hypothesised that reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular signalling agents during lymphocyte activation .
14,16 G#cell_type

in the current study , cysteamine , an aminothiol compound with antioxidant activity , has been used to further investigate the role of oxidative signalling during lymphocyte activation .


treatment of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes with cysteamine in vitro was found to inhibit proliferation in a dose-dependent manner , with essentially complete inhibition occurring at a dose of 400 microm .
3,7 G#cell_type

this inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time-frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .


it therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .


taking the il-2 gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors ap-1 , nf-kappa b , nf-at and oct1 , whose functions are required for expression of the il-2 mrna .
2,3 G#protein|2,4 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA|28,30 G#protein|30,31 G#protein|32,34 G#protein|35,36 G#protein|37,38 G#protein|47,48 G#protein

cysteamine treatment inhibited both expression of the il-2 mrna and secretion of il-2 into the culture medium .
7,8 G#protein|7,9 G#RNA|12,13 G#protein

the inhibitory effect of cysteamine may be mediated at least in part by an effect on transcription factor function , as the dna binding activities of ap-1 and nf-kappa b extracted from mitogen-stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment .
16,18 G#protein|26,27 G#protein|28,30 G#protein|32,34 G#cell_type

interestingly , oct1 and nf-at dna binding activity were not affected by cysteamine treatment , suggesting that oxidative signalling processes operate in a selective manner .


the identification of regulatory proteins , such as transcription factors , as molecular targets for oxidative signalling provides further evidence to implicate oxidative signalling as being intimately involved in the g0 to g1 phase transition in t lymphocytes .

sex and age distribution of 1,25(oh)2d3 receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal human subjects .
5,7 G#protein|8,12 G#cell_type

specific receptors for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d3 have been described in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) .
11,15 G#cell_type|16,17 G#cell_type

we have tried to find out whether these receptors could show any difference in sex or age distribution .


twenty two healthy men aged 21-66 yr ( mean +/- sd 41.0 +/- 13.6 ) and nineteen healthy women aged 22-60 yr ( 38.9 +/- 13.9 ) have been studied .


the mean dissociation constant ( kd ) was similar in both sexes ( 1.35 +/- 0.70 x 10(-10) m in males , 1.13 +/- 0.66 x 10(-10) m in females ) , but the concentration of binding sites ( nmax ) was significantly lower in females ( 2.32 +/- 0.92 fmol/10 ( 7 ) pbmc vs 4.43 +/- 1.38 fmol/10(7) pbmc in males ; p = 0.0001 ) .
54,55 G#cell_type|60,61 G#cell_type

neither kd nor nmax were significantly correlated with age .


no difference was found between pre and post menopausal women .


further studies are needed to elucidate if this sex difference in pbmc receptors for 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin d3 is of any pathophysiological relevance .

expression of id2 and id3 mrna in human lymphocytes .
2,6 G#RNA|7,9 G#cell_type

helix-loop-helix ( hlh ) transcription factors are involved in cellular growth and differentiation .
0,1 G#protein|2,3 G#protein|0,6 G#protein

the id ( inhibitor of dna binding and differentiation ) hlh proteins , in a dominantly negative fashion , regulate transcriptional activities of basic hlh proteins .
1,2 G#protein|10,12 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

we examined by northern hybridization the expression of id2 and id3 mrna in human leukemia/lymphoma lines and patient samples , as well as resting and activated normal human lymphocytes from peripheral blood ( pbl ) .
8,12 G#RNA|13,16 G#cell_line|25,29 G#cell_line|33,34 G#cell_type

the id2 mrna was abundantly expressed in 5/12 t-cell and 3/4 b-cell lines , and id3 mrna was detected in 4/12 t-cell and 3/4 b-cell lines .
1,2 G#protein|1,3 G#RNA|7,9 G#cell_line|10,13 G#cell_line|15,16 G#protein|15,17 G#RNA|20,22 G#cell_line|23,26 G#cell_line

interestingly , id2 , but not id3 , mrna was strongly expressed in 4/5 t-cell lines infected with human t-cell leukemia virus type i ( htlv-i ) ( atl-1k , mt-2 , s-lb1 ) and type ii ( mo ) .
2,3 G#protein|2,3 G#RNA|6,7 G#protein|6,7 G#RNA|13,16 G#cell_line|28,29 G#cell_line|30,31 G#cell_line|32,33 G#cell_line|38,39 G#cell_line

another unexpected finding was that t-cell leukemias and t-cell lines often expressed either id2 or id3 mrna .
8,10 G#cell_line|13,14 G#protein|13,14 G#RNA|15,16 G#protein|15,17 G#RNA

in addition , resting pbl constitutively expressed prominent levels of id2 mrna , but not id3 mrna .
4,5 G#cell_type|3,5 G#cell_type|10,11 G#protein|10,12 G#RNA|15,16 G#protein|15,17 G#RNA

upon pha -stimulation , id2 expression decreased and id3 levels increased with biphasic kinetics .
1,2 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

taken together , our studies revealed three unexpected findings which require further analysis : ( 1 ) expression of id2 mrna is often associated with lymphocytic transformation by htlv-i or -ii ; ( 2 ) t-cells usually express either id2 or id3 mrna , but b-cells often express both simultaneously ; ( 3 ) non-dividing , normal pbl express high levels of id2 and no id3 mrna ; and with the onset of cellular proliferation , levels of id2 mrna decrease while levels of id3 mrna increase , suggesting that regulation of expression of these closely related genes is disparate .
19,20 G#protein|19,21 G#RNA|39,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein|41,43 G#RNA|57,58 G#cell_type|62,63 G#protein|65,66 G#protein|65,67 G#RNA|78,79 G#protein|78,80 G#RNA|84,85 G#protein|84,86 G#RNA|97,98 G#DNA

salicylates inhibit lipopolysaccharide -induced transcriptional activation of the tissue factor gene in human monocytic cells .
12,15 G#cell_type

binding of plasma factor vii/viia to the tissue factor ( tf ) receptor initiates the coagulation protease cascades .
2,5 G#protein|7,13 G#protein|15,17 G#protein

tf expression by circulating monocytes is associated with thrombotic and inflammatory complications in a variety of diseases .
3,5 G#cell_type

transcriptional activation of the human tf gene in monocytic cells exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) is mediated by binding of c-rel /p65 heterodimers to a kappa b site in the tf promoter .
4,7 G#DNA|8,10 G#cell_type|22,25 G#protein|27,30 G#DNA|32,34 G#DNA

here , we report that a family of anti-inflammatory agents , known as the salicylates , inhibited lps induction of tf activity and tf gene transcription in human monocytes and monocytic thp-1 cells at clinically relevant doses .
23,25 G#DNA|27,29 G#cell_type|30,33 G#cell_line

furthermore , sodium salicylate blocked the lps -induced proteolytic degradation of i kappa b alpha , which prevented the nuclear translocation of c-rel /p65 heterodimers .
11,15 G#protein|22,25 G#protein

in contrast , two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , ibuprofen and indomethacin , did not inhibit lps induction of the tf gene .
20,22 G#DNA

these results indicated that salicylates inhibited lps induction of tf gene transcription in monocytic cells by preventing nuclear translocation of c-rel /p65 heterodimers .
9,11 G#DNA|13,15 G#cell_type|20,23 G#protein

the clinical benefits of salicylates in the treatment of several diseases , including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis , may be related to their ability to reduce monocyte gene expression .


activation of the signal transducer and transcription ( stat ) signaling pathway in a primary t cell response .
8,9 G#protein

critical role for il-6 .
3,4 G#protein

the t cell activation is initiated by interaction of specific ags with tcr , followed by activation of intracellular biochemical events leading to activation of several genes .
10,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein

the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ) proteins in a primary tcr -mediated activation of t cells have been explored .
8,13 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

in purified human peripheral blood t cells , nuclear stat proteins were activated approximately 3 h after activation by cross-linked anti-cd3 abs .
5,7 G#cell_type|1,7 G#cell_type|8,11 G#protein|20,22 G#protein

these stat proteins were detected by using the ifn-gamma-activated sequence ( gas ) and related oligonucleotides as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .
1,3 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA

analysis of the nuclear extracts with anti-stat abs indicated that they contained stat-3 and additional proteins crossreactive with the stat family .
6,8 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|19,21 G#protein

the induction of stat activity was inhibited completely by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or cyclosporin a , thus indicating that the induction was due to a secondary factor produced by the activated t cells .
3,4 G#protein|26,28 G#protein|32,34 G#cell_type

as neutralizing anti- il-6 abs effectively down-regulated the early induction of stat proteins and as exogenously added il-6 rapidly activated dna binding similar to tcr -mediated bindings , it can be concluded that il-6 is the factor responsible for the activation of stat proteins in a primary t cell response .

the normal cell cycle activation program is exploited during the infection of quiescent b lymphocytes by epstein-barr virus .
12,15 G#cell_type

b lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation are maintained in a non-proliferative state .
0,2 G#cell_type

antigen recognition stimulates limited proliferation , whereas infection with epstein-barr virus ( ebv ) results in continual proliferation and the outgrowth of immortal cell lines .
22,25 G#cell_line

because it is not clear at which point in cell cycle the peripheral b lymphocytes are arrested , we characterized the expression of several cell cycle-associated genes in quiescent and stimulated cells .
13,15 G#cell_type|12,15 G#cell_type|24,27 G#DNA|28,32 G#cell_type

we show that the expression of four cell genes , cdc-2 , cyclin e , cd23 , and cyclin d2 , are up-regulated approximately 100-fold as a result of ebv -mediated immortalization .
7,9 G#DNA|10,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|15,16 G#DNA|18,20 G#DNA

because these genes play a positive role in cell proliferation , we suggest that this regulatory switch contributes to controlling entry into the cell cycle .


transient stimulation of quiescent b lymphocytes with either a cocktail of anti-cd40 , anti-igm , and il4 , or ebv results in the rapid expression of the same four genes , suggesting that , after infection , ebv exploits the normal program of b-lymphocyte cell cycle activation .

expression of the chemokine receptor blr2/ebi1 is specifically transactivated by epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 2 .
3,5 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|10,15 G#protein

in our attempt to identify chemokine receptors that are related to burkitt 's lymphoma receptor 1 ( blr1 ) and are expressed in activated lymphocytes we used rt-pcr resulting in the isolation of a cdna encoding a seven transmembrane receptor termed blr2 .
5,7 G#protein|11,16 G#protein|17,18 G#protein|23,25 G#cell_type|37,40 G#protein|41,42 G#protein

the protein shows significant sequence similarities to the family of g-protein coupled chemokine receptors and turned out to be identical to the recently described receptor ebi1 .
10,11 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|10,14 G#protein|24,26 G#protein

northern blot analysis revealed that blr2 mrna could be highly stimulated in mitogen- and anti-cd3- treated peripheral blood lymphocytes .
5,6 G#protein|5,7 G#RNA|12,19 G#cell_line

blr2 -specific mrna could be detected in all epstein-barr virus positive b cell lines .
0,1 G#protein|0,3 G#RNA|8,14 G#cell_line

we show that transcription of the blr2 gene could be specifically induced in epstein-barr virus negative bl 41 cells via estrogen-mediated activation of epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen 2 , a key regulator of viral and cellular genes in immortalized b cells .
6,7 G#protein|6,8 G#DNA|13,19 G#cell_line|23,28 G#protein|33,34 G#DNA|35,37 G#DNA|33,37 G#DNA|38,41 G#cell_line

our data suggest an involvement of blr2 in the regulation of migration in activated lymphocytes and in viral pathogenesis .

a central role for a single c-myb binding site in a thymic locus control region .
5,9 G#DNA|11,15 G#DNA

locus control regions ( lcrs ) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors .
0,3 G#DNA|4,5 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|17,20 G#protein

a 2.3-kb lcr in the human adenosine deaminase ( ada ) gene first intron , which controls expression in thymocytes , is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin .
1,3 G#protein|5,12 G#DNA|5,14 G#DNA|19,20 G#cell_type|25,28 G#DNA|37,38 G#DNA

prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements .
6,7 G#DNA|9,12 G#DNA|16,18 G#DNA

we now show that the core contains a single critical c-myb binding site .
10,13 G#DNA

in both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells , c-myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences .
2,6 G#cell_line|8,11 G#cell_line|12,13 G#protein|14,17 G#DNA|19,22 G#DNA

c-myb protein was strongly evident in t lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures .
0,1 G#protein|0,2 G#protein|6,8 G#cell_type|11,12 G#DNA

fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ada and human ada lcr -directed transgene expression .
9,10 G#DNA|14,16 G#DNA|17,20 G#DNA

point mutation of the c-myb site within the intact 2.3-kb lcr severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and lcr activity in transgenic thymocytes .
4,5 G#protein|4,6 G#DNA|9,11 G#protein|18,19 G#DNA|22,23 G#cell_type|21,23 G#cell_line

within the context of a complex enhancer and lcr , c-myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site .

a regulatory element in the human interleukin 2 gene promoter is a binding site for the zinc finger proteins sp1 and egr-1 .
1,3 G#DNA|5,10 G#DNA|12,14 G#DNA|16,19 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein

activation of the interleukin 2 ( il-2 ) gene after antigen recognition is a critical event for t cell proliferation and effector function .
3,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|3,9 G#DNA

prior studies have identified several transcription factors that contribute to the activity of the il-2 promoter in stimulated t lymphocytes .
5,7 G#protein|14,15 G#protein|14,16 G#DNA|17,20 G#cell_type

here we describe a novel regulatory element within the il-2 promoter located immediately upstream of the nuclear factor of activated t cell ( nfat ) domain .
5,7 G#DNA|9,11 G#DNA|16,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|16,26 G#DNA

this region ( termed the zinc finger protein binding region ( zip ) ) serves as binding site for two differently regulated zinc finger proteins : the constitutively expressed transcription factor sp1 and the inducible early growth response protein egr-1 .
5,10 G#DNA|11,12 G#DNA|22,25 G#protein|27,31 G#protein|31,32 G#protein|34,39 G#protein|39,40 G#protein

in unstimulated cells which do not secrete il-2 , only sp1 binds to this region , while in stimulated il-2 secreting cells the inducible egr-1 protein recognizes this element .
1,3 G#cell_type|7,8 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|18,22 G#cell_line|24,25 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

in jurkat t cells , the zip site serves as an activator for il-2 gene expression , and a combination of zip and nfat binding sites is required for maximal il-2 promoter activity .
1,4 G#cell_line|6,7 G#DNA|6,8 G#DNA|13,14 G#protein|21,22 G#DNA|23,24 G#protein|23,26 G#DNA|30,31 G#protein|30,32 G#DNA

these results suggest a critical role of the zip site for il-2 promoter activity .

activation of the hiv-1 enhancer by the lef-1 hmg protein on nucleosome-assembled dna in vitro .
3,5 G#DNA|7,10 G#protein|11,13 G#DNA

lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 ( lef-1 ) is a regulatory high mobility group ( hmg ) protein that activates the t cell receptor alpha ( tcr alpha ) enhancer in a context-restricted manner in t cells .
0,4 G#protein|5,6 G#protein|9,17 G#protein|20,24 G#protein|25,27 G#protein|20,29 G#DNA|34,36 G#cell_type

in this paper we demonstrate that the distal region of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 ( hiv-1 ) enhancer , which contains dna-binding sites for lef-1 and ets-1 , also provides a functional context for activation by lef-1 .
11,18 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA|24,25 G#protein|36,37 G#protein

first , we show that mutations in the lef-1 -binding site inhibit the activity of multimerized copies of the hiv-1 enhancer in jurkat t cells , and that lef-1 /gal4 can activate a gal4-substituted hiv-1 enhancer 80- to 100-fold in vivo .
8,9 G#protein|8,11 G#DNA|15,17 G#DNA|19,21 G#DNA|22,25 G#cell_line|28,29 G#protein|28,30 G#protein|34,36 G#DNA|33,36 G#DNA

second , recombinant lef-1 is shown to activate hiv-1 transcription on chromatin-assembled dna in vitro .
3,4 G#protein|2,4 G#protein|11,13 G#DNA

by using a nucleosome -assembly system derived from drosophila embryos , we find that the packaging of dna into chromatin in vitro strongly represses hiv-1 transcription and that repression can be counteracted efficiently by preincubation of the dna with lef-1 ( or lef-1 and ets-1 ) supplemented with fractions containing the promoter-binding protein , sp1 .
3,4 G#protein|19,20 G#DNA|39,40 G#protein|42,43 G#protein|44,45 G#protein|51,53 G#protein|54,55 G#protein

addition of tfe-3 , which binds to an e-box motif upstream of the lef-1 and ets-1 sites , further augments transcription in this system .
2,3 G#protein|8,10 G#DNA|13,17 G#DNA

individually or collectively , none of the three enhancer-binding proteins ( lef-1 , ets-1 , and tfe-3 ) could activate transcription in the absence of sp1 .
8,10 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|25,26 G#protein

a truncation mutant of lef-1 ( hmg-88 ) , which contains the hmg box but lacks the trans-activation domain , did not activate transcription from nucleosomal dna , indicating that bending of dna by the hmg domain is not sufficient to activate transcription in vitro .
1,3 G#protein|4,5 G#protein|6,7 G#protein|12,14 G#protein|17,19 G#protein|25,27 G#DNA|35,37 G#protein

we conclude that transcription activation by lef-1 in vitro is a chromatin -dependent process that requires a functional trans-activation domain in addition to the hmg domain .

hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins induce activation of activated protein-1 in cd4+ t cells [ published erratum appears in j biol chem 1995 dec 1 ; 270 ( 48 ) : 29038 ]
0,3 G#protein|7,8 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|9,12 G#cell_type

activation of cd4 positive t cells is a primary requirement for human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) entry , efficient hiv replication , and progression to aids , utilizing cd4 positive t cell lines and purified t cells from normal individuals , we have demonstrated that native envelope glycoproteins of hiv , gp 160 , can induce activation of transcription factor , activated protein-1 ( ap-1 ) .
4,6 G#cell_type|2,6 G#cell_type|29,34 G#cell_line|36,38 G#cell_type|35,38 G#cell_type|46,49 G#protein|52,54 G#protein|59,64 G#protein|65,66 G#protein

the stimulatory effects of gp160 are mediated through the cd4 molecule , since treatment of gp160 with soluble cd4-igg abrogates its activity , and cd4 negative t cell lines fail to be stimulated with gp160 .
4,5 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|24,29 G#cell_line|34,35 G#protein

immunoprecipitation of the gp 160 -induced nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies to fos and jun proteins indicates that ap-1 complex is comprised of members of these family of proteins .
3,5 G#protein|9,11 G#protein|12,13 G#protein|14,16 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

the gp160 -induced ap-1 complex is dependent upon protein tyrosine phosphorylation and is protein synthesis-independent .
1,2 G#protein|3,4 G#protein|1,5 G#protein

this stimulation can also be abolished by inhibitors of protein kinase c , but it is unaffected by calcium channel blocker or cyclosporine a .
9,12 G#protein

this gp160 treatment adversely affects the functional capabilities of t cells : pre-treatment of cd4+ t cells with gp160 for 4 h at 37 degrees c inhibited anti-cd3 -induced interleukin-2 secretion .

effects similar to gp160 were seen with anti-cd4 mab .
3,4 G#protein|7,9 G#protein

the aberrant activation of ap-1 by gp160 in cd4 positive t cells could result in up-regulation of cytokines containing ap-1 sites , e.g. interleukin-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , and concurrently lead to t cell unresponsiveness by inhibiting interleukin-2 secretion .
